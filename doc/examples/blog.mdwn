This is an [[example_blog|index]]. Just copy the blog subdirectory into
your wiki to quickly get started blogging with ikiwiki. 

Or, run this command to set up a blog with ikiwiki.

	% ikiwiki --setup /etc/ikiwiki/auto-blog.setup

Some additional configuration you might want to do, if not using
`auto-blog.setup`:

* Make sure to configure ikiwiki to generate RSS or Atom feeds.

* Make sure you have the [[tag|plugins/tag]] plugin enabled, and the
 `tagbase` set to "tags". Tag pages will then automatically be created.
  An example of how to tag a post is:
	\[[!tag life]]

* Enable the [[pagestats|plugins/pagestats]] plugin to get a tag cloud
  to display on the [[index]].

* Enable the [[comments|plugins/comments]] plugin to
  enable comments to posts to the blog.

* Enable the [[calendar|plugins/calendar]] plugin and run the
  [[ikiwiki-calendar]] command from cron daily to get an interlinked
  set of calendar archives.
