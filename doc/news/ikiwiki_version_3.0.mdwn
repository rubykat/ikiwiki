Ikiwiki has reached version 3.0 and entered a new phase in its
[[development_cycle|roadmap]].

The 3.0 release of ikiwiki changes several defaults and finishes
some transitions. You will need to modify your wikis to work with
ikiwiki 3.0. A document explaining the process is available
in [[tips/upgrade_to_3.0]].

The highlights of the changes in version 3.0 include:

* Support for uploading [[attachments|plugins/attachment]].
* Can [[plugins/rename]] and [[plugins/remove]] pages and files via the web.
* [[Web_based_setup|plugins/websetup]].
* Blog-style [[plugins/comments]] as an alternative to Discussion pages.
* Many other new plugins including [[plugins/htmlbalance]], [[plugins/format]],
  [[plugins/progress]], [[plugins/color]], [[plugins/autoindex]],
  [[plugins/cutpaste]], [[plugins/hnb]], [[plugins/creole]], [[plugins/txt]],
  [[plugins/amazon_s3]], [[plugins/pinger]], [[plugins/pingee]],
  [[plugins/edittemplate]]
* The RecentChanges page is compiled statically, not generated from the CGI.
* Support for additional revision control systems: [[rcs/bzr]],
  [[rcs/monotone]]
* Support for [[tips/untrusted_git_push]].
* A new version (3.00) of the plugin API, exporting additional
  commonly used functions from `IkiWiki.pm`.
* Nearly everything in ikiwiki is now a plugin, from WikiLinks to
  page editing, to RecentChanges.
* Far too many bug fixes, features, and enhancements to list here.
