I've gone ahead and moved ikiwiki.info to the faster box mentioned on
[[server_speed]]. Most poll respondants felt the old box was fast enough,
but it's getting a bit overloaded with other stuff.

If you can see this, you're seeing the new server. If not, your DNS server 
hasn't caught up yet. I'll keep the old server up for a while too and merge
any changes across since git makes that bog-easy.

Please report any problems..
