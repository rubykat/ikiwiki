ikiwiki.info has upgraded to the not yet released ikiwiki 2.30. This
version of ikiwiki drops support for subscribing to commit mail
notifications for pages. The idea is that you can subscribe to the new
[[RecentChanges]] feed instead. (Or create your own custom feed of only the
changes you're interested in, and subscribe to that.)

So if you were subscribed to mail notifications on here, you'll need to
change how you keep track of changes. Please let me know if there are any
missing features in the [[RecentChanges]] feeds.

Statically building the RecentChanges also has performance implications,
I'll keep an eye on [[server_speed]]..
