  [ [[Joey Hess|joey]] ]

  * Fix NULL ptr deref on ENOMEM in wrapper. (Thanks, igli)

  [ [[Simon McVittie|smcv]] ]

  * Really don't double-decode CGI submissions, even on Perl versions that
    bundle an old enough Encode.pm for that not to be a problem: the
    system might have a newer Encode.pm installed separately, like Fedora 20.
    (Closes: [[!debbug 776181]]; thanks, Anders Kaseorg)
  * If neither timezone nor TZ is set, set both to :/etc/localtime if
    we're on a GNU system and that file exists, or GMT otherwise
  * t/inline.t: accept translations of "Add a new post titled:"
    (Closes: [[!debbug 779365]])
  * Consistently document command-line options as e.g. --refresh, not -refresh

  [ [[Amitai Schlair|schmonz]] ]

  * In VCS-committed anonymous comments, link to url.

  [ [[Joey Hess|joey]] ]

  * Fix XSS in openid selector. Thanks, Raghav Bisht.
    (Closes: [[!debbug 781483]])
