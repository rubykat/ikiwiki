ikiwiki-hosting is an interface on top of Ikiwiki to allow easy management
of lots of ikiwiki sites. I developed it for
[Branchable](http://www.branchable.com/), an Ikiwiki hosting provider.
It has a powerful, scriptable command-line interface, and also
includes special-purpose ikiwiki plugins for things like a user control
panel.

To get a feel for it, here are some examples:

	ikisite create foo.ikiwiki.net --admin http://joey.kitenet.net/
	ikisite branch foo.ikiwiki.net bar.ikiwiki.net
	ikisite backup bar.ikiwiki.net --stdout | ssh otherhost 'ikisite restore bar.ikiwiki.net --stdin'

ikiwiki-hosting is free software, released under the AGPL. Its website:
