I was asked a good question today: How can a company find someone to work
on ikiwiki? To help answer this question, I've set up a [[consultants]] page.
If you might be interested in being paid to work on ikiwiki, please add your
information to the page. --[[Joey]]

And here's the first company looking for an ikiwiki developer that I am
aware of:

> The TOVA Company, a small medical software and hardware company in
> Portland, Oregon, is looking for developers to add functionality to
> ikiwiki. We're looking for developers who are already familiar with ikiwiki
> development, including plugins, and who would be willing to work on a
> part-time, non-employee, project-based basis for each of the small features
> that we want. The [[features_we're_interested_in|users/The_TOVA_Company]]
> would obviously be GPL'd, and released to the community (if they'll have
> them :) ). Please contact Andrew Greenberg (andrew@thetovacompany) if
> you're interested. Thanks!
