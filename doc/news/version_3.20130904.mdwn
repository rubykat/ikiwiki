ikiwiki 3.20130904 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * calendar: Display the popup mouseover when there is only 1 page for a
     given day, for better UI consistency.
   * meta: Can now be used to add an enclosure to a page, which is a fancier
     way to do podcasting than just inlining the media files directly;
     this way you can write a post about the podcast episode with show notes,
     author information, etc.
     (schmonz)
   * aggregate: Show author in addition to feedname, if different.
     (schmonz)
   * Consistently configure LWP::UserAgent to allow use of http\_proxy
     and no\_proxy environment variables, as well as ~/.ikiwiki/cookies
     (schmonz)
   * Fix test suite to work with perl 5.18. Closes: #[719969](http://bugs.debian.org/719969)"""]]
