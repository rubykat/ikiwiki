I've produced a [code_swarm](http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/codeswarm/)
visualization of the first 2+ years of ikiwiki's commit history.

PS, while I'm posting links to videos, here's a 
[video of a lightning talk about ikiwiki](http://log.hugoschotman.com/hugo/2008/07/webtuesday-2008-07-08-lightning-talk-by-axel-beckert-about-ikiwiki.html).

### notes

Interesting things to watch for:

* Initial development of ikiwiki to the point it was getting web edits. 
  (First 2 seconds of video!)
* Introduction to plugin support, and later, plugin changes dominating code
  changes.
* Introduction of openid support and the resulting *swarm* of openid
  commenters.
* Switch to git, my name in the logs changes from "joey" to "Joey Hess",
  and there are more code commits directly from others.

Getting the commit log was tricky because every web commit is in there too,
so it has to deal with things like IPs and openids. The [[code_swarm_log.pl]]
script will munge the log to handle these, and it was configured with
[[code_swarm.config]].

Video editing by kino, ffmpeg, ffmpeg2theora, and too many hours of pain.

Audio by the Punch Brothers.
