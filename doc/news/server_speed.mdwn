Quick poll: Do you feel that ikiwiki is fast enough on this server, or
should I move it to my much beefier auxiliary server?

[[!poll open=no 40 "It's fast enough" 6 "It's too slow!" 4 "No opinion"]]

If you have specifics on performance issues, you might mention them on the
[[discussion]] page.

Ikiwiki is now hosted at [Branchable](http://branchable.com/).
