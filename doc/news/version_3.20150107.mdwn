  [ [[Joey Hess|joey]] ]

  * Added ikiwiki-comment program.
  * Add missing build-depends on `libcgi-formbuilder-perl`, needed for
    `t/relativity.t`
  * openid: Stop suppressing the email field on the Preferences page.
  * Set Debian package maintainer to Simon McVittie as I'm retiring from
    Debian.

  * calendar: add `calendar_autocreate` option, with which `ikiwiki --refresh`
    can mostly supersede the `ikiwiki-calendar` command.
    Thanks, Louis Paternault
  * search: add more classes as a hook for CSS. Thanks, sajolida
  * core: generate HTML5 by default, but keep avoiding new elements
    like `<section>` that require specific browser support unless `html5` is
    set to 1.
  * Tell mobile browsers to draw our pages in a device-sized viewport,
    not an 800-1000px viewport designed to emulate a desktop/laptop browser.
  * Add new `responsive_layout` option which can be set to 0 if your custom
    CSS only works in a large viewport.
  * style.css, actiontabs, blueview, goldtype, monochrome: adjust layout
    below 600px ("responsive layout") so that horizontal scrolling is not
    needed on smartphone browsers or other small viewports.
  * core: new `libdirs` option alongside `libdir`. Thanks, Louis Paternault

  * core: log a debug message before waiting for the lock.
    Thanks, Mark Jason Dominus
  * build: in po/Makefile, use the same `$(MAKE)` as the rest of the build.
    Thanks, ttw
  * blogspam: use the 2.0 JSON API (the 1.0 XML-RPC API has been EOL'd).
    Closes: [[!debbug 774441]]

  [ [[Joey Hess|joey]] ]

  * po: If msgmerge falls over on a problem po file, print a warning
    message, but don't let this problem crash ikiwiki entirely.
