News for ikiwiki 3.20160506:

   To mitigate [[!cve CVE-2016-3714]] and similar ImageMagick security vulnerabilities,
   the `\[[!img]]` directive is now restricted to these common web formats by
   default:

   * JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`)
   * PNG (`.png`)
   * GIF (`.gif`)
   * SVG (`.svg`)

   (In particular, by default resizing PDF files is no longer allowed.)

   Additionally, resized SVG files are displayed in the browser as SVG
   instead of being converted to PNG.

   If all users who can attach images are fully trusted, this restriction
   can be removed with the new img\_allowed\_formats setup option.
   See [[ikiwiki/directive/img]] for more details.

   * HTML-escape error messages, in one case avoiding potential cross-site
     scripting ([[!cve CVE-2016-4561]], OVE-20160505-0012)
   * Mitigate ImageMagick vulnerabilities such as CVE-2016-3714:
     - img: force common Web formats to be interpreted according to extension,
       so that "allowed\_attachments: '*.jpg'" does what one might expect
     - img: restrict to JPEG, PNG and GIF images by default, again mitigating
       CVE-2016-3714 and similar vulnerabilities
     - img: check that the magic number matches what we would expect from
       the extension before giving common formats to ImageMagick
   * d/control: use https for Homepage
   * d/control: add Vcs-Browser
 * [ [[Joey Hess|joey]] ]
   * img: Add back support for SVG images, bypassing ImageMagick and
     simply passing the SVG through to the browser, which is supported by all
     commonly used browsers these days.
     SVG scaling by img directives has subtly changed; where before
     size=wxh would preserve aspect ratio, this cannot be done when passing
     them through and so specifying both a width and height can change
     the SVG's aspect ratio.
   * loginselector: When only openid and emailauth are enabled, but
     passwordauth is not, avoid showing a "Other" box which opens an
     empty form.
 * [ [[Amitai Schlair|schmonz]] ]
   * mdwn: Process .md like .mdwn, but disallow web creation.
 * [ Florian Wagner ]
   * git: Correctly handle filenames starting with a dash in add/rm/mv."""]]
