What directory is the 'working copy'? There can be two interpretations: the current dir and the .git dir.

The page says *"Note that this file should **not** be put in your wiki's directory with the rest of the files."* Why is that?

One possible thing is security: Is it just a precaution or would anyone with "write" access to wiki be able to replace the file?

>> Thanks. After all found it here: [[security]]. Now I wonder if I always use a file from the master branch, while limiting users to staging, it might fly...
