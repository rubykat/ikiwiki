I recreated this post in the tips section [Ikiwiki with git-annex, the album and the underlay plugins](http://ikiwiki.info/tips/Ikiwiki_with_git-annex__44___the_album_and_the_underlay_plugins/) as per anarcats suggestion

Yes I can see that some have use for that function. I try to provide hi-res version of all my images as they are more useful for people. For the stockholm site though I've halved the size already as there are to many photos and of to dubious quality... and it's easy enough to do that locally before uploading.

As you can see on the [about](http://stockholm.kalleswork.net/tech/) page I use a shell script to do the metadata stuff even adding the actual download link for the hi-res version. Couldn't figure out how to do in in album.pm before I opted for a simpler solution ;) So for me local work is necessary anyway atm.

Another potential problem with the underlay is how changes to underlay files would be detected?

Feel free to delete this whole forum post in favor of the version in tips.
