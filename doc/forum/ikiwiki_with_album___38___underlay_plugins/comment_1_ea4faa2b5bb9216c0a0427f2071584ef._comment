\"I guess the plugins have to setup and upload to underlaydir somehow\" -
yes, the hypothetical specialized CGI interface mentioned at the end of
[[plugins/contrib/album]] would ideally be able to do that.

I'd also like to be able to keep full-resolution photos on my laptop
but mangle them down to a more web-compatible resolution in a
separate underlay that is what actually gets uploaded, also as described
on that page - but that doesn't make a great deal of sense for a
non-CGI workflow, since if you're uploading full-resolution photos to
the CGI, you've already done the big data transfer whether you
intended to or not :-)
