hi, 
I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong but I can't figure out how to get a download link for uploaded attachments.
I'd like to be able to upload arbitrary attachments eg. settings.xml or .gitinore or setup.txt or stuff.zip and be able to add a link to the wiki page which should let the user instantly download that file.
I thought it might be as simple as adding a directive eg. [[!downloadlink .gitinore]] .

This is driving me nuts, so any help or pointers will be appreciated even if I have to dig in to write a plugin.
I'm running the 3.20100815.9 on Debian 6.0  but then also tried a manual install of 3.20130904.1 which seemed to have caused a bunch of timeout errors and not much improvement on the attachment issue. 
Should  I try the git version?

thanks
marius
