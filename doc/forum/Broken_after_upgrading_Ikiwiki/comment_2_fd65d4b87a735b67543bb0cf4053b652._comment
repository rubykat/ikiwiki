Your setup file seems to refer to a \"scrubber\" plugin, which has never existed in ikiwiki. Perhaps a typo of \"htmlscrubber\"?

3.20100815.7 is an old version of ikiwiki. The current version avoids the rst docutils breakage. Installing python-docutils on Debian can work around that problem as well.
