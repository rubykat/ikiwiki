Hello,

I have started using Ikiwiki for a personal site, which is great. I would like to add search functionality with the search plugin, so have it configured with the one parameter needed, and it does see files.

However, it seems to be doing a couple things with URLs that it shouldn't in this case:

* The link to the page has an extraneous "/cgi" in it, e.g. instead of "https://[hostname]/sandbox/" it has ""https://[hostname]/cgi/sandbox/". 
* Also, the help link is the same, so links to "https://[hostname]/cgi/ikiwiki/searching/".

Another question I had is whether I can restrict the pages which get searched? I would like to have an internal section which isn't linked, and which doesn't pop up in search results. I know that I can configure the web server to restrict access, but would prefer that the page snippet and its presence not be advertised.

  Thanks!
  Tim
