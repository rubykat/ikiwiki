The CGI automatically builds self-referential URLs based on how you
accessed it, so if your web host puts it behind a
[reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) or
something, that might make it try to redirect to localhost?

If that's it, then `$q->url` with `$params{cgiurl}` in
`IkiWiki/CGI.pm` and `IkiWiki/Plugin/openid.pm` would work around it.
