well, it seems that if I do set up the author and authorurl meta variables in the index.mdwn, I get the author in the ATOM feed file. I don't know why, if it is because the feed creation is invoked from that page or if it is automagically taken from the main page.

At the same time, the rss feed does not get the author, even if the default template should have included it for each item in the feed.
