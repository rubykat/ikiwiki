Change the [[ikiwiki/pagespec]] in the `inline`, for instance from
`posts/*` to `page(posts/*)`.

`page(*)` only matches \"pages\" (things that get rendered to HTML, which is just
`.mdwn` files in a default ikiwiki, but can include other things with the right
plugins).

On my blog I use \"`2* and copyright(*)`\", which is a bit of a hack: it matches
files in the directories I use for posts (which are year-based), but only if
they have an explicit copyright statement - which my blog posts do, but
\"structural\" pages (like a list of all posts from 2011) don't.
