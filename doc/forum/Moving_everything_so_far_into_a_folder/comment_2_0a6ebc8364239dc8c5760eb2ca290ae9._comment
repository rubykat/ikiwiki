This would work, but there's another problem (of convenience): Since the notes directory is my working directory for notes, I would like to move the notes (this the main reason for trying to do this), so I don't have to see them all the time. I would like to be able to refer to the files in the future, without having to see them. But, I guess, this is not so easily done. But if someone has an idea for a \"native\" ikiwiki solution I'd be very grateful.
