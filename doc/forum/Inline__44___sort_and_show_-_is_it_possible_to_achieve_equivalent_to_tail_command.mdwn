As per above. I'm using a inline to show most recent pages using meta(date). I want to limit the number of items to 20 but here is the catch I want to maintain chronological order. Kind of like using `sort -n | tail`.

Showing the `n` oldest pages in chronological order starting with the first is easy just combine sort and show. Same thing goes for showing the `n` most recent pages in reverse chronological order.

Can't figure out if what I want to do is doable.

A bit of background:
I'm using my [[tweaked img plugin|kjs]] to populate meta data from images. The meta date is set according to the image exif data. On the homepage I show thumbnails of the 20 most recent images. This is a site of family photos (why I can't share the link here) and such and it's a bit confusing to show all sequences in reverse. I.e first image shows all the presents opened then they repackage themselves and end up with ribbons.
