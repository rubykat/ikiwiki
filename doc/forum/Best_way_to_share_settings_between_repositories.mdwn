I like the idea of having some common configuration (let's say of plugins) in my main server (with cgi and websetup enabled) as well as on other repositories clones and copies. In the ideal situations only some dir settings should be different (src, dest, lib, etc.) in the different setup files.

Managing two setup files (one for the server and one for the laptop) is however a pain since each time a change is made on the server (through websetup for instance) one has to manually integrated it (after being made aware of it) on each clone setup file and vice-versa.

What is a good way to share such settings (without having to copy them twice or more) ?

I tried to discuss that same point in [[laptop_wiki_with_git discussion|tips/laptop_wiki_with_git/discussion]].
