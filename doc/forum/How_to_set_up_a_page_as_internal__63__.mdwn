I have a folder with few administrative tasks, like a page showing the comments waiting for moderation.

There is no link from "normal/public" pages in my site to this administrative pages, but it doesn't prevent the possibility of any person writing down that address in the browser address-bar or finding that address in the browser navigation history.

Please, is there any way or best-practice restricting the access to this kind of pages? I know that these pages will eventually ask the user to log-in as admin, but I don't want them to see this stuff.
