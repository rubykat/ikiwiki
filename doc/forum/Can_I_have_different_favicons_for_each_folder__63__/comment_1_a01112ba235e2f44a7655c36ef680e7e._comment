You could use [[plugins/pagetemplate]] to override all of `page.tmpl`, but
that's using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

Another way to do it would be to modify `IkiWiki/Plugins/favicon.pm`
to use `bestlink` to find the favicon, like [[plugins/localstyle]] does.
If you made it a config option (`localfavicon => 1` or something)
it could probably be included in ikiwiki as part of the official
[[plugins/favicon]] plugin?

Another way would be to have a new `localfavicon` plugin which overrides
the template variable from [[plugins/favicon]], using `last => 1` to
make sure it \"wins\".
