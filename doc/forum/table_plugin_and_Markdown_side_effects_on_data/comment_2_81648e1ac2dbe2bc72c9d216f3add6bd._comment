Well, it's already easy to turn off htmlization and preprocessing of cell contents as Markdown by renaming the file with the table directive (which references my TSV file) from \"foo.mdwn\" to \"foo.wiki\" but when I do that the URLs in the TSV file are no longer turned into clickable links. My hack of not processing certain Markdown syntax, such as ignoring \"#\" when it's at the beginning of a cell, is more what I want. Actually, making links clickable is the only Markdown processing of my data that I want.
