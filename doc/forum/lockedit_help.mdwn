I'm having some trouble getting the lockedit plugin to work as I'd expect.

We have a small in-house wiki that should be public-viewable, but only editable by a few users.
I've added these users to the `adminuser` keyword in my `.setup` file:

    adminuser:
      - user1
      - user2
      - user3

`lockedit` is enabled:

    add_plugins:
      - lockedit

And the `locked_pages` is set to '*':

    locked_pages: '*'

However, I can still edit all pages using any user.  To test I simply created a new user
by attempting to edit a page while not logged in.  After creating the user I could edit the
page.
