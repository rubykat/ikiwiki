Another update on this, because it's related to running ikiwiki on nearly free speech: ikiwiki, xapian (and omega; for search), pandoc and pandoc-cteproc and I believe all perl modules one would need to run all of this are installed system wide on the white beta realm. So getting an ikiwiki up and running is nowadays a piece of cake and consists of calling `ikiwiki --setup /usr/local/etc/ikiwiki/auto.setup`, filling in the correct infos and afterwards customizing the created `.setup` file further. That's already it. Plugins can be installed to `~/.ikiwiki/IkiWiki/Plugin`. By setting a `templatedir` in the `.setup`you can have a templatedir in your user's dir.
