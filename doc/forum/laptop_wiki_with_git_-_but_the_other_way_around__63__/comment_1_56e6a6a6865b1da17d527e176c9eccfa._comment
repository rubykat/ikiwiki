I was able to make some progress with this by taking a somewhat different approach. First of all I understand now a little better, that the above setup could be made to work, but it is easier to setup a wiki on my server by hand and then setting up the server repository as a remote of my local repository. After merging/combining the two repos (e.g.: pulling from the server with `--allow-unrelated-histories` and then pushing the local repo to the server) I had a state in which I could let ikiwiki run on my server clone of the local wiki.

There's still work to do. I run into problems with exceeding the cpu time limit when trying to do a full rebuild which, because of the complexity of the wiki takes a while. Is there a way to do cumulative rebuilds or something like that?

I also will have to see how well plugins will work on nearly free speech.
