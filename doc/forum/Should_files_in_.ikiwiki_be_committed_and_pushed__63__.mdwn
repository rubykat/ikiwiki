In my local working copy, I discovered a .ikiwiki directory with files and subdirectories. What are they for in a working copy? Should them be committed to central repository (origin) on remote server?

    $ git status
    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #	new file:   .ikiwiki/commitlock
    #	new file:   .ikiwiki/indexdb
    #	new file:   .ikiwiki/lockfile
    #	new file:   .ikiwiki/transient/recentchanges/change_0326ad7c7aa2c40b8db5d59033ecda7ed4d61295._change
    <snip>

Should these be committed and pushed?
