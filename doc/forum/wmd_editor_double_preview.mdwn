I use the wmd editor in my ikiwiki. However live preview seems not to be a fully correct preview so nevertheless I have to hit the preview button to get a correct preview. However then I have two previews so that I have to scroll down to see the correct one.

Is it possible to disable the live preview or to *replace* the live preview with the correct one after pressing the preview button?
