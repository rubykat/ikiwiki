I did indeed have opendiscussion active.  I shall wait to see what happens after disabling it.

The bots seem to make 5 consecutive edits at short intervals (around 2 minutes) using an IP 
address as a username.  I do not know if the IP is the one from which they work.  There are 
usually two or three sets of five edits using different IP addresses as username in each hour.

I did try blocking specific IPs but they constantly change.

It would be good if blocking could match a regexp, but as far as I can see this is not an option,
