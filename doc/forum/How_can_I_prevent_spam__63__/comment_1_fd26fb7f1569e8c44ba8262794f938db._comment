Normally ikiwiki requires a valid session cookie of a logged in user to edit pages. It sounds like you may have the opendiscussion or anonok plugins enabled, which allows anyone to edit without logging in. Recommend disabling them.

Since you know the spammer's IP, put it into ikiwiki.setup:

<pre>
banned_users:
  - ip(85.25.146.11)
</pre>

If the user was logging in, you could also put their username in the ban list.

You can also try enabling the blogspam plugin.
