If you use the [[plugins/rename]] plugin and go page-by-page, it will update backlinks for you.

If you want to move a lot of files, such that it is impractical to do one at a time, you could write a script that

 * moved each page to the new location
 * replaced the old page with one containing a [[plugins/meta]] redirect to the new location.
