Because of the complexity and size of my wiki, I am unable to let ikiwiki run it's course on my shared hosting provider of choice. The maximum time allowed for a rebuild as is dictated by the maximum amount of cpu time I can assign myself to is 10 minutes. What I wanted to know is: Is there a way to run ikiwiki in chunks of 10 minutes steps or something like that?
