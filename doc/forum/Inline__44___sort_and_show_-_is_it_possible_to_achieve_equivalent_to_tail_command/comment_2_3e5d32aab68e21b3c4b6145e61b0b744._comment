I could do a patch if I could program... The img plugin stuff is more a working accident of mine ;)

For now I've reverted to showing all albums in reverse chronological order. Atleast then people aren't confused by different ordering of the homepage inline and the actual album.

I'll see if I can have a look at the show last patch as you suggest, but that won't happen shortly.

Regards
