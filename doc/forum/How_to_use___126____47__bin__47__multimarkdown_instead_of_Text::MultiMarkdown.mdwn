I want to configure IkiWiki to use Fletcher Penney's recent version of [[MultiMarkdown|http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown]] instead of the default perl implementation.
I don't know perl, but I think I need to replace the mdwn.pm plugin with something that uses "open2".
Please help me get started. -- [[tjgolubi]]
