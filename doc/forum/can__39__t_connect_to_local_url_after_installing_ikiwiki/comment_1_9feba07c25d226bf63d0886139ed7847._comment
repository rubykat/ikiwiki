This is probably not the cause of your problem, but please don't do this. ikiwiki
should always be run as an ordinary user, never as root. If it runs as root, any
bugs in ikiwiki could have very bad consequences.

(I'm tempted to make it just exit with an error message if run as root, actually.)

ikiwiki does not include a web server (http server), so you cannot edit via a
browser without providing one.

`auto.setup` tries to guess at some reasonable defaults that will work on a
reasonable number of Unix machines: it assumes that `~/public_html` is
mapped to `http://${hostname}/~${username}/` by your web server. This is
the default configuration on many Linux and *BSD systems; I don't know
whether that's true on OS X or not.

It also assumes that an executable named `ikiwiki.cgi` in `public_html`
will be run as a CGI script. Again, this is often true, but not always.

Perhaps we should have some wording like

```
If you have a web server running, your site might be available at:

     url:         http://kund-Mac-2.local/~root/RelatiicuPublicul
     srcdir:      ~/RelatiicuPublicul
     destdir:     ~/public_html/RelatiicuPublicul
     repository:  ~/RelatiicuPublicul.git
```

as a hint that ikiwiki has done what it can, and the rest is up to you?

I think we fixed this in the latest version of ikiwiki, so you might not
be running the current version (that won't affect this particular
issue, but there are other improvements).
