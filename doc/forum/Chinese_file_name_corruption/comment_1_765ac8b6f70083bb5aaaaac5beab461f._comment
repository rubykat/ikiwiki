It's hard to tell from this small screenshot what I'm supposed to be looking at, but the \"Parent directory\" and date suggests this is an apache dirindex listing, which has nothing to do with ikiwiki.

Ikiwiki is (or attempts to be) utf-8 clean on filenames and content, so as long as you use that encoding and have the requisite fonts your chinese filenames will display ok in ikiwiki. Apache probably doesn't try to get this right at all, or needs some more configuration.
