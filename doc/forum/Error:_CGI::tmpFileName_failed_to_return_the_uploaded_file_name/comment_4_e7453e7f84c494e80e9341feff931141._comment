This could be [#786586](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=786586) and [#786587](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=786587), which have a matching symptom. (The two Debian bugs are aspects of the same thing.)

Workaround: remove libcgi-pm-perl and use the older CGI.pm in Perl.
