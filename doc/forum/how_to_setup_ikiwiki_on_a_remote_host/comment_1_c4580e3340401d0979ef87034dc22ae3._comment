Get a cheap VPS from [lowendspirit](http://lowendspirit.com/). 3 euro/year!

It's perfect for running ikiwiki and some other services for a personal site. 

Note: You only get ipv6 and NAT ipv4, but the forums explains how you can setup domains and things to get a website working. I have one with ikiwiki and it's great.
