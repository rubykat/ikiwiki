This looks like [Debian bug #776181](https://bugs.debian.org/776181), although I'm
surprised you're seeing it on such an old version of Encode. What version of IkiWiki
is this?

Please try reverting the change you made to Encode.pm, and making the change to IkiWiki
shown on that bug report instead. (If you don't know how to read diffs, the short version
is: delete the lines prefixed with \"-\", add the lines prefixed with \"+\".)

I've made the same change in ikiwiki git master, so this should be fixed in the
next release (>= 3.20150301).
