./pm_filter /usr/local 3.20141016.1 /usr/local/share/perl5 < ikiwiki.in > ikiwiki.out
/bin/sh: ./pm_filter: /usr/bin/perl5.18.15.18.1: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
make: *** [ikiwiki.out] Error 126

Kind of a newbie and I'm not sure what is happening here--when it invokes the perl interpreter is it somehow adding the version twice? Not sure what to do... I appreciate any help/advice.
