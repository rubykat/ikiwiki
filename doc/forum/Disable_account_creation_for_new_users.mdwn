Hi, 
I'm planning on abusing ikiwiki as a mini-CMS for a static website and think it's exactly the right system for it. Great stuff btw.

But I still got a problem that I can't solve at the moment. For the static website (with commenting enabled tho) I want no one else to edit the pages, i.e. I want to turn off the editing function for everyone except me. 

That works with the lockedit plugin so far, and I can also hide the edit and preferences links on the pages. But if someone manually enters the link to the edit page he/she can still create an account (I have disabled openid and plan to use passwordauth only). The account can then not be used to edit pages but still, everyone can create accounts in userdb over and over. Is there a way to solve that? I just don't see it right now.

Best regards,
Chris
