I am using ikiwiki for a spanish language wiki. I've read the [[translation]] page and [[plugins/po]] plugin page but it is not completely clear to me. As I understand it the po plugin is the recommended way to create translated versions of existing pages in your wiki based on a master language.  But I actually don't need that as myself and other users already edit the wiki in spanish.  What I would actually like is to have the ikiwiki interface itself translated into spanish. 
Is it possible to have my wiki always appear in spanish? I can see that the debian package already includes po files for spanish.  How do i activate the spanish translation permanently? Did I miss something obvious?
