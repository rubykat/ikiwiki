I assume this is a bug:

When when writing the string "S." on a page, it gets replace with "a." for some reason. I am using "ikiwiki version 3.20150614" form pkgsrc on OS X 10.10.4.

If this is not a bug: Where would I be able to change that behaviour?

P.S.: "S." is the short form of the German "Seite" (en: "p." and "page") and is used frquently in citations, so it's kind of importantâ€¦
