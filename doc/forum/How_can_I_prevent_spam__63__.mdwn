I am getting continuous spam like this:

    discussion  85.25.146.11  web  11:02:19 05/17/13  2rand[0,1,1]
    discussion  85.25.146.11  web  11:02:13 05/17/13  2rand[0,1,1]

The bot uses an IP address as the username and puts '2rand[0,1,1]' as comment text.

I do not have a page 'discussion' in use, so I have redirected this page with an apache2
Alias to a static page, just in case anyone stumbles on it.  This means it cannot really 
be edited via the web. However the bots that post 
this spam are evidently not opening the page to edit it, but merely sending a cgi request 
as if they had edited the page.  The result is that no damage is done on the site and no 
benefit is achieved for the spammer since google cannot see the result.  However, the 
logs are stuffed with spurious entries and a page is constantly recompiled, which wastes 
resources.  

Is there some way to reject edits that do not arise from an established session?
