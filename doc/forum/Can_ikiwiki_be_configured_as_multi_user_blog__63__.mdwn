All the ikiwiki blogs I have seen have a single user blog. Is it possible to give every user a blog, where they can create their own pages in their own directory = based on their user name? 

I feel that a wiki might give more options in the way users share and collaborate when compared to a blog engine (like Word Press in multi user format)

Is this the best place to post a question like this? There doesn't seem to be much traffic in this forum
Thanks for your help
