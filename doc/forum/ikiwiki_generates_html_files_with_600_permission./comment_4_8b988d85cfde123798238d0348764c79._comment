Joey merged my branch, so from the next release of ikiwiki you'll be able
to say `umask => 'public'` (or `private` or `group` for the other two
potentially-useful umasks).

I'm not sure what you mean about mixing modes? The wrapper modes are
something else - the wrapper modes are about who can run the CGI (or the
git commit hook) and whether they're setuid (run as the user who owns
the wiki) or not (run as the web server user or the git push user),
whereas `umask` is about the permissions that ikiwiki will assign to
new files it creates (like the HTML).

A typical public wiki like this one will have `umask => 'public'`;
the wrapper modes will either be `0755` or `04755` (both octal),
depending on the details of how the web server runs the CGI
and how git pushes are done.
