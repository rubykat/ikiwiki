Your shell login to the server (presumably SSH?) is running under a
restrictive `umask`, and by default ikiwiki doesn't overrule that.
For instance, perhaps you're using the `pam_umask` module, or
perhaps your `.bashrc` sets a restrictive mask. This is generally
a good thing for privacy from other users of a shared server, but
counterproductive when you're publishing things!

You can configure ikiwiki to set a less restrictive `umask` with
the `umask` option in your setup file. 18 is probably a good value
(18 decimal = 022 octal, and a `umask` of 022 octal corresponds
to `chmod 0755`, because the `umask` is subtracted from 0777 octal
to get the default permissions).
