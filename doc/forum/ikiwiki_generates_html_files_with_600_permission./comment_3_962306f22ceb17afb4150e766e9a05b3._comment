thank you for your enlighting post! i set the umask option to 022 (octal) and the wrapper to 0755 and it worked. However i guess it is not a good thing to mix modes and i would appreciate it, if you implemented the \"keyword-approach\" you mentioned.

Or at least one way of defining modes would be okay for average joes like me.
