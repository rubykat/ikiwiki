Has anyone else created ikiwiki themes for mobile devices like phones and tablets?

I've been using Blueview theme for a few years and finally tried to adapt the theme for my phone.
My local.css is [here](http://mcfrisk.kapsi.fi/local.css), and my hobby web page full of images and videos [here](http://mcfrisk.kapsi.fi/skiing/).

Previously I also had problems like wasted screen space, big minimum width and images not scaled down to the CSS element. Those got fixed as well.
Would be nice if others could test that and maybe share their setups.
