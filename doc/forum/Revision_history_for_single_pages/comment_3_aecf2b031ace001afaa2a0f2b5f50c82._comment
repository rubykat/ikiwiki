`historyurl` is the setting in the `.setup` file: it just links to an external history viewer, which is likely to be more advanced and better-suited to your [[RCS]] than anything built into ikiwiki would be. Use your favourite viewer for the RCS you're using - ikiwiki.info uses gitweb, you could also use something like cgit - and write `\[[file]]` where you want the filename to appear.
