After fixing cgi config

    git_wrapper: '/home/qazwsx/space-pages/repo.git/hooks/post-update'
    cgi_wrapper: '/home/qazwsx/public_html/space-pages/ikiwiki.cgi'

, rebuilding, modifying some .md file, git commit & push, it now works.

The git wrapper is the executable that lives in your git repository, and is used to accept git pushes. The cgi wrapper is the executable that is visible by your web server, and is run by the web server when requests come in from the web
