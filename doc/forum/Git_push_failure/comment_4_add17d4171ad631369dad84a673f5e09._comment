It looks as though either your git hook is running ikiwiki with '--cgi', or you have
`cgi: true` (or equivalent Perl) in the setup file, or you generated the git hook using
`ikiwiki ... --cgi --wrappers` or similar. This is not correct: `cgi: true` does not
mean \"enable CGI\", it means \"always run in CGI mode\", which is not what is desired.
