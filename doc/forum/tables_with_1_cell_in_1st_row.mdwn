Just found a bug while building a table with 1st column made of the lines output by <tt>ls -1</tt>. That means, in the beginning there's only 1 cell in each row, and if adding additional columns in other rows, the delimiter ('|') is taken as-is. No difference if the table has a header line or not, or if that one cell is following a '|'.

Examples:


### 2 cells each

table with header

[[!table data="""
1 | 2
one | two
a |b
"""]]

table without header

[[!table header="no" data="""
1 | 2
one | two
a |b
"""]]

### 2 cells, 3 later


table with header

[[!table data="""
1 | 2
one | two
a |b | c
"""]]

table without header

[[!table header="no" data="""
1 | 2
one | two
a |b | c
"""]]

### 1 cell, 3 later


table with header

[[!table data="""
1
one | two
a |b | c
"""]]

table without header

[[!table header="no" data="""
1
one | two
a |b | c
"""]]

### 1 cell (ended by delimiter), 3 later


table with header

[[!table data="""
1|
one | two
a |b | c
"""]]

table without header

[[!table header="no" data="""
1|
one | two
a |b | c
"""]]

### 1 cell (line starts with delimiter), 3 later


table with header

[[!table data="""
|1
one | two
a |b | c
"""]]

table without header

[[!table header="no" data="""
|1
one | two
a |b | c
"""]]

### 1 cell (line starts with SPC + delimiter), 3 later


table with header

[[!table data="""
 |1
one | two
a |b | c
"""]]

table without header

[[!table header="no" data="""
 |1
one | two
a |b | c
"""]]
