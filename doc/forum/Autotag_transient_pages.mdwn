During my adventures tweaking the album plugin to read image metadata I've
encountered some unexpected behavior. My tweaks populate the [[tag]] from the
xmp:subject tag in the image and the file is written to the transient
underlay. 

The tag links get created but the corresponding /tag/* page isn't auto created
until I run a full --rebuild. Checked in pages appear to get instantly
autotagged and their tag pages created.

There is some discussion about autotagging and transients on this site. But I
can't quite descipher what is now the expected behaviour with autotagging and transients.

Anyone able to explain if the above scenario is as it should be? (for whatever
reason) --[[kjs]]
