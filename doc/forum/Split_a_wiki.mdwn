Is it possible to split an ikiwiki (with git backend) in to two?

Suppose I have an ikiwiki called myiki

which contains the pages

pageA1,pageA2,...,pageB1,pageB2,...

now I want to have two wikis called myikiA and myikiB

such that

myikiA contains pageA1,pageA2,...

The history of myikiA should contain the whole history of those pages but no history of pageB1,pageB2,...

and 

myikiB contains pageB1,pageB2,...

The history of myikiB should contain the whole history of those pages but no history of pageA1,pageA2,...
