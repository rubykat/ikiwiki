Hello,

I would like to use !taglink to create a series of links, which are also tags, in the main part of my wikipages.  But since these will already be on the page, there's no need to have them at the bottom of the page.  Is there any way to turn off the display of tags (and also of backlinks) at the bottom of the page?  I understand I could just delete the sections from page.tmpl but wondered if there was a more elegant way to do it.  Thanks.
