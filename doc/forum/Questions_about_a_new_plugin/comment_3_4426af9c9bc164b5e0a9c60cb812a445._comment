I think this might be the right place to \"cut the knot\": instead of indirecting
through the \"latest\" page, why not something like this? (this is pseudocode
describing a hypothetical plugin, not something you can do right now):

    # index.mdwn
    [[!report pages=\"newest(sismologie/*)\" ...]]

Or you could keep the indirection but make it explicit, without introducing
copying:

    # sismologie.mdwn
    [[!inline pages=\"./*\" trail=\"yes\" sort=\"age\"]]

    # index.mdwn - assume ... is a glob that matches sismologie but not its subpages
    [[!report pages=\"first-trail-member(...)\"]]

(`first-trail-member` doesn't exist, but it could.)

Or maybe a distinct data structure:

    # sismologie.mdwn
    [[!versions pages=\"./*\"]]

    # index.mdwn - assume ... is a glob that matches sismologie but not its subpages
    [[!report pages=\"version-of(...)\"]]
"""]]
