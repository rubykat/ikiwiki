I'm not so sure that copying metadata around is the right solution to the
use case that you outlined. If you do that, then `/doc/v2.0/` and `/doc/` will
be indistinguishable anywhere that pages are listed by their metadata - it's as
though you'd copied the text content of `doc/v2.0.mdwn` into `doc.mdwn`. For
example, if it's tagged `readme`, then a list of pages matching `tagged(readme)`
will have two apparently identical entries, one of which is `/doc/` and the other
is `/doc/v2.0/`.

Why not do this instead?

```
# doc/v2.0.mdwn
[[!tag readme]]
[[!meta title=\"Foobar documentation, version 2.0\"]]

[[!if test=\"doc/* and created_after(.)\" all=\"no\"
  then=\"\"\"[[!template id=\"note\" text=\"[Newer versions are available|doc]\"]]\"\"\"]]

Here is new documentation about Foobar.

# doc/v1.0.mdwn
[[!tag readme]]
[[!meta title=\"Foobar documentation, version 1.0\"]]

[[!if test=\"doc/* and created_after(.)\" all=\"no\"
  then=\"\"\"[[!template id=\"note\" text=\"[Newer versions are available|doc]\"]]\"\"\"]]

Here is documentation about Foobar.

# doc.mdwn
[[!meta title=\"Foobar documentation\"]]
[[!inline pages=\"doc/*\" limit=\"1\" sort=\"age\" feeds=\"no\" actions=\"no\" raw=\"yes\"]]

Older versions:

[[!inline pages=\"doc/*\" skip=\"1\" archive=\"yes\"]]
```

... or even (with a bit of new code)

```
# doc.mdwn
[[!meta redir_first_match=\"doc/*\" sort=\"age\"]]
```

In real life you'd probably want to use a special `[[!template]]` for the link
to the latest version, so that it's easier to make them all consistent, but
for those examples I'm just using the standard [[templates/note]] and some markup.

Why not ask us about your real use-case, in case it turns out that it *doesn't*
match exactly after putting more thought into it? :-)
