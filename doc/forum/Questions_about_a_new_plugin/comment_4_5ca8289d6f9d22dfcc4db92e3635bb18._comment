I like your idea of a pagespec:

    # index.mdwn - assume ... is a glob that matches sismologie but not its subpages
    [[!report pages=\"first-trail-member(...)\"]]

What I have in mind now, assuming that my website have the following structure:

    $ tree
    ├── blog.mdwn
    └── blog
        ├── bar.mdwn
        ├── bar
        │   ├── 20151108.mdwn
        │   └── 20160413.mdwn
        ├── foo.mdwn
        └── foo
            ├── 20160103.mdwn
            └── 20160605.mdwn

I can have a plugin that implements:

- a directive ``[[!versionof parent]]`` in every *actual* article (`bar/20151108.mdwn`, `bar/20160413`, `foo/20160103`, `foo/20160605`) which does two things:
  - it registers the pages as being a version of its parent page;
  - it displays a text ``Other versions of this article: ...``.
- a pagespec function ``latestversion``, so that the ``blog.mdwn`` page can list the last version of each article using something like ``[[!report pages=\"*/* and latestversion()]]``;
- a directive ``[[!redir_to_latest_version]]`` (or a nicer, shorter name) in *'meta'* articles (`foo.mdwn`, `bar.mdwn`), which redirects the page to the latest version of the article (so that ``http://example.com/blog/foo`` redirects to ``http://example.com/blog/foo/20160605`` (the latest version of ``foo``)).

Anyway, thank you very much: it may not be the definitive form yet, but it is already much more clean than it was at the beginning.
