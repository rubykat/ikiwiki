Ikiwiki version: ikiwiki version 3.20160905~bpo8+1 running on Debian Jessie. 

I have a page with directives something like the following: 

    \[[!edittemplate match="worklog/" template="templates/worklog.tmpl" silent="yes"]]
    \[[!inline pages="worklog/*" rootpage=worklog postformtext="Record worklog entry for {{$title}}" archive="no" show="0"]]

The template `worklog.tmpl` looks something like this: 
    
    Time: <TMPL_VAR TIME>
    Title: <TMPL_VAR TITLE> 
    MTIME: <TMPL_VAR MTIME>

The form to create a worklog renders, and I can click the button. I get the right template. But the rendered template looks something like

    Time: 2016-09-18T04:57:54Z
    Title:  
    MTIME: 

In other words: `<TMPL_VAR TIME>` works, and no other `TMPL_VAR` directives do (that I have been able to find). They all seem to be blank. I have been doing some source diving and it looks as if they ought to exist, but nothing is ever rendered. 

My long-term goal is to make some custom template variables, but at this point I cannot even get the builtins working, other than `time`. 

I am using a bunch of other plugins like `getfield` and `field`, but I do not know if any of them are the culprit. Here is the list from my `ikiwiki.setup` file: 

          add_plugins => [qw{goodstuff prettydate templatebody
          template edittemplate httpauth date
          attachment inline field getfield ymlfront
          listdirectives sqlite_search sidebar}],


What am I doing wrong?
