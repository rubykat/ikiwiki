I've updated [[Jason Blevin|users/jasonblevins]]'s pandoc plugin to permit tighter integration between Ikiwiki and [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). Given the features Pandoc has added over the past 6-12 months, this makes for a very powerful combination, e.g. with code block syntax highlighting and lots of options for how to process and display inline TeX. See <https://github.com/dubiousjim/pandoc-iki> for details.

How do I get this added to the contrib section of the plugin list? --Profjim
