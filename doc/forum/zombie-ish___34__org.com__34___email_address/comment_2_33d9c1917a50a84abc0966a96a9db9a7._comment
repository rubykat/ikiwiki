If you are logging in using [[plugins/passwordauth]] or [[plugins/httpauth]],
your email address as used in Preferences is your choice, and you should be
able to change it via Preferences.

If you are logging in using OpenID, your email address as used in Preferences comes
from your OpenID provider.

Either way, it's stored in [[the userdb|tips/inside_dot_ikiwiki]].
