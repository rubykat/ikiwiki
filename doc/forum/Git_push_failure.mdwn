I set up a local Ikiwiki following the instruction on [manually installing](https://ikiwiki.info/setup/byhand/).  However, when I Git push, I see the following


    $ git push
    Counting objects: 22, done.
    Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (22/22), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (22/22), 2.71 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.

    remote: Content-type: text/html
    remote: 
    remote: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
    <skip>


where the content at the bottom of the console printout is actually the content of my `rootdir/index.mdwn`.  And the destination, i.e. the deployed web documents is not automatically updated reflecting the commits I pushed to Git repo.  Any idea?

I'm using ikiwiki version 3.20150107 on Ubuntu Linux 14.0.4 LTS.
