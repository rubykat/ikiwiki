I am attempting to edit tips/dot_cgi/ [[tips/dot_cgi/discussion]], but I get this error:

    Error: Sorry, but that looks like spam to blogspam: Single-word too long: '\[[http://maketech...]]'

Note: that link appeared in a /previous/ version of the discussion page, not my own edit.

Hope this helps, cheers!

p.s. I got the same error when trying to post here, so I edited the string to be shorter.

p.p.s. I got the same error again for the link to tips/dot_cgi/discussion, so I changed that link in a silly way...
