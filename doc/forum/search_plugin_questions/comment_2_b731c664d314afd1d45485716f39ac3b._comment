Thanks. The url parameter is the full hostname, e.g. http://example.com
The cgiurl parameter is the url plus the path to the CGI, e.g. http://example.com/cgi/iw.cgi

Regular operation of Ikiwiki seems fine, so I can log in, edit pages and so on. As far as the more private part goes, the site is essentially just me, so there won't be pages with odd parameters in them unless I add them.  :)
