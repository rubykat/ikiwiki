It sounds as though the `url` and/or `cgiurl` settings in your setup
file might be wrong. What are they? What is the actual \"root\" URL
of your wiki in your web server, and what is the actual URL of the
CGI script?

Regarding private stuff, I would recommend making a separate ikiwiki
instance for that, particularly if your wiki accepts edits from
untrusted people. For instance, anyone who can insert a \[[!map]]
directive can easily enumerate every page in your wiki.
