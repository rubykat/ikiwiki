IkiWiki's own [[bugs]], [[news]] and [[to-do list|todo]] are functionally
equivalent to blogs, in fact. ([[news]] is the most obviously blog-like,
[[bugs]] is like a blog except that solved bugs disappear from the
page/feed, and [[todo]] only shows titles, not content, but is otherwise
like [[bugs]].)
