Ikiwiki is a wiki, so you can certainly have multiple users. Any user
with appropriate access can create any number of blogs: they just need
to put an [[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive on any page they can
edit, with a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] pointing to pages (blog posts) in a
directory where they can create pages.

If you want a limited set of users to be able to edit the wiki without
making them full wiki admins, you can use [[plugins/lockedit]]:

    locked_pages: * and !(user(bob) or user(chris))

or if you want \"most\" users to only be able to write on their own blog, and
not on other users' blogs (for instance: Alice the wiki admin can edit
anything, but Bob can only edit `users/bob/...` and Chris can only edit
`users/chris/...`) then you can use [[plugins/lockedit]], something like:

    locked_pages: * and !(user(bob) and (users/bob or users/bob/*)) and !(user(chris) and (users/chris or users/chris/*))

(Wiki admins can always edit locked pages.)

If you have lots of users and you know a bit of Perl, you might want
to [[write a plugin|plugins/write]] that adds a function-like
[[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] like `owndirectory(users)`, which would match if
there is a logged-in user and the page being edited is equal to or
a subpage of their directory in users.
