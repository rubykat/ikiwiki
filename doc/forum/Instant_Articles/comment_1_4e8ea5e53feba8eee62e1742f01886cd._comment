If it's a compatible extension to RSS (adds new elements but doesn't require changing much/anything in the existing feed), I don't see why not. I think you'd just need to adapt `templates/rssitem.tmpl` and `templates/rsspage.tmpl`. Please contribute your changes as a [[git]] branch and/or a [[todo]] item.

If Facebook also supports Atom, I'd prefer to use that instead of RSS - RSS is poorly specified, and the Atom spec fixes a lot of the vagueness.
