On the recent changes page, edits are listed with a username which is a link to the corresponding user page. I'd like the commits from git to show up with the correct username, but am unsure how Ikiwiki sources this info. It doesn't seem to correspond to "git config user.name", for instance.

Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks!
