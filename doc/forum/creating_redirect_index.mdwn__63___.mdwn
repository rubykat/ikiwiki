Hi - we are switching to ikiwiki for the Savannah documentation <http://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance>.  I installed the Debian ikiwiki package and it is working fine.  My question: is it possible to redirect the top-level index.mdwn to another page?  (Traditionally we have used <http://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/FrontPage>.)  

Sorry if this is obvious.  I looked around for existing plugins or methods, but what I found seemed to have other prerequisites that I could not easily figure out, and looked to be more about moving pages than redirecting.  I could do it at the Apache level, but I thought it would be simpler and cleaner to do it within ikiwiki itself if possible (e.g., with some plugin+directive in index.mdwn?).  

Any pointers or info greatly appreciated.  Thanks,
karl@gnu.org
