Wouldn't use the `//` in the URL, to make the URL protocol relative, solve the problem? It [seems to be already used](http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=IkiWiki.pm;h=fe5af6d15a769250879accb6592b45d84f5c555e;hb=HEAD#l680), but if you ask this question, this means that the rss feed does not use it. Now someone has to track how the feed url is generated, and why it does not use this protocol-relutive URL (sorry, I will not do this myself: I would not find the time to do so these days).
