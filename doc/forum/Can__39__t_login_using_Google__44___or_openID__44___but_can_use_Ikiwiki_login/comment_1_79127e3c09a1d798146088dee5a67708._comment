That error message means that the user has logged in, but the lockedit plugin has been configured, via `locked_pages` to not let some pages be edited by them.

Inability to log in with openid is a separate problem, I can only guess as you didn't say how it fails when you try to log in by openid, but perhaps you need to install the Net::OpenID::Consumer perl module from cpan.
