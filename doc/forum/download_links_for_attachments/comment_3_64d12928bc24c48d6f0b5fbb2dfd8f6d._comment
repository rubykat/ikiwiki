[[setup.txt]] - opens the plain text in the same browser window
[[settings.xml]] - opens the formatted xml as html i.e. I can't right click and save as, I have to copy the text, create an empty file and paste it in
[[.gitignore]] - it does not recognise this file, I have to rename it to gitignore.txt and explain to the user to rename it.

What I would like is a way to consistently get a dialog that asks the user where to save the file with the correct default file name..
I've recently figured out how to do this with javascript - it's a bit messy but it works:
