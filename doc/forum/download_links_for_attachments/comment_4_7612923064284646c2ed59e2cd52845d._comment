> \[[setup.txt]] - opens the plain text in the same browser window

That's the browser's choice: the web server says \"this is text/plain\"
and the browser decides to display it in the window. IkiWiki doesn't
actually serve the file, just provides a link to it; to force it
to be downloaded rather than opened, you'd have to configure
your web server to offer it as \"Content-Disposition: attachment\"
(e.g. <http://www.jtricks.com/bits/content_disposition.html>).

The only way IkiWiki could get involved in this would be to
have the file download go via the CGI script, which could
add that header. That isn't currently a feature it has;
you could maybe add a plugin if you need this?

> \[[settings.xml]] - opens the formatted xml as html

Again, this is between the web server and the browser.

> \[[.gitignore]] - it does not recognise this file

IkiWiki excludes files related to the source code control systems
it uses, in order to avoid accidentally publishing a `.gitignore`
that's intended to control ignored files for the git repo
containing the pages' source. This is controlled by the
`wiki_file_prune_regexps`, `exclude` and `include` config options.
You can put `.gitignore` in `include` if you need to publish
files with that name.
