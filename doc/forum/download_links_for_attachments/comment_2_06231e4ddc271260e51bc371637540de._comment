It should be as simple as putting the attachment's name in double square
brackets, like `\[[stuff.zip]]`? There isn't really any difference
between a download link and any other link.

(Or if it's attached to a different page, follow the same
[[ikiwiki/subpage/linkingrules]] as for pages, e.g. you might
write `\[[sandbox/stuff.zip]]` for a file attached to the [[sandbox]].)
