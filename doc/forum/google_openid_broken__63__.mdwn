Now that google supports using thier profiles as OpenIDs, that can be used
directly to sign into ikiwiki. Just use, for example, 
<http://www.google.com/profiles/joeyhess> . Tested and it works. --[[Joey]] 

> This seems to work fine if you use the profile directly as an OpenID.  It doesn't seem to work with delegation.  From that I can see, this is a deliberate decision by Google for security reasons.

### adding the GMail OpenID as an admin is unhandy
Adding the non-human-friendly OpenID from Gmail as an admin for ikiwiki (if you haven't set up a profile with a readabe URL) is unhandy; first, you need to discover the URL, for example, by making a web edit with it (like me [here](http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=search;s=https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id%3Fid%3DAItOawl3JW_Ow4xMqj98Ig1vwGx_AnjUSsgwE8E;st=author)), and then copy the URL to ikiwiki.setup. --Ivan Z.

## historical discussion

when I login via to this wiki (or ours) via Google's OpenID, I get this error:

Error: OpenID failure: no_identity_server: The provided URL doesn't declare its OpenID identity server. 

Any idea how to fix this??

So, while the above bug will probably get fixed sooner or later,
the best approach for those of you needing a google openid now is
to use gmail.


Just a note that someone has apparently figured out how to use a google
openid, and not a third-party provider either, to edit this site. 
The openid is
<https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=AItOawltlTwUCL_Fr1siQn94GV65-XwQH5XSku4>
(what a mouthfull!), and I don't know who that is or how to use it since it
points to a fairly useless xml document, rather than a web page. --[[Joey]]

> That string is what's received via the discovery protocol. The user logging in with a Google account is not supposed to write that when logging in, but rather <https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id>. The OpenID client library will accept that and redirect the user to a sign in page, which will return that string as the OpenID. It's not really usable as an identifier for edits and whatnots, but an alternative would be to use the attribute exchange extension to get the email address and display that. See <http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OpenID.html#Parameters>.

> Yahoo's OpenID implementation works alike, but I haven't looked at it as much. It uses <https://me.yahoo.com/> to receive the endpoint.

> I've added buttons that submit the two above URLs for logging in with a Google and Yahoo OpenID, respectively, to my locally changed OpenID login plugin.

> Using the Google profile page as the OpenID is really orthogonal to the above. --[[kaol]]
