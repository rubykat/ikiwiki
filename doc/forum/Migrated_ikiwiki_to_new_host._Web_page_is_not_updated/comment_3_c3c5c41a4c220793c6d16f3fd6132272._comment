I now set up virtual host in apache2 and fudged the ipnumber to correspond to hostnames the ikiwiki uses. I do not want to update DNS before I have checked the site works.

Now I can log in using OpenID and edit the wiki via browser. This time the web pages are updated and the changes I made appear in the wiki. 

I cheched the gitorigin_branch setting was empty string even in 2009 when I got this wiki. I begin to suspect editing the wiki using a git checkout would not work even in the host the ikiwiki is currently running on, and maybe did not work in the host it was running on in 2009. 

It looks to me like ikiwiki is working on this new host except git configuration is somehow messed up. It is possible I never did use git checkout on the old host.
