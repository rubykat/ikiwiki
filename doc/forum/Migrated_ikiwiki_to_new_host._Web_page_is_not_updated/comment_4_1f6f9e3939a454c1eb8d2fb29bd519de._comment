I did 
    git clone src.git
on the host ikiwiki is currently running on, and got an old version of the wiki, not the one that is diplayed on the web page.

So even there editing via browser works, but git checks out an old version and the changes I make do not get shown on the web page after git push. 

This new host I set up is thus no worse, actually slighty better now because git clone at least gets me the sources the web pages are generated from.

How to figure out what is wrong with ikiwiki setup in the using git part?
