If just deleting the unwanted pages is insufficient (e.g. perhaps they
contain information that must not be made public), you can split a git
repository (including ikiwiki repositories) with `git filter-branch` (see
[this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359424/detach-subdirectory-into-separate-git-repository),
for instance).

This preserves the history of each individual page, but rewrites the
entire history of the repository (it re-does every commit, pretending
that the addition of the omitted pages and every subsequent edit to
them had never happened); it's like `git rebase` but more so.

As a result, existing branches will no longer be able to push to the
rewritten repository.
