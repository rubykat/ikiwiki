Is it right at the beginning of a line, such that Markdown interprets it as a numbered list item for an HTML `<ol>`?

~~~
a. One
b. Two
c. Three

a. One
a. Two
a. Three

S. One
X. Two
Z. Three
~~~

are all interpreted as

a. One
b. Two
c. Three

If this is what's going on, you can use:

`p\. 49`

to get:

p\. 49

or adjust your spacing so it isn't the first thing on a line.
