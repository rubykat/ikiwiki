I installed a new wiki on my local machine. When I click on edit, I get the following error:

`Error: cannot write to /home/user/myiki2/.ikiwiki/lockfile: Permission denied`

I checked the permissions of that file and assured that they are the same as in my other working ikiwiki, but it doesn't help. Any idea?
