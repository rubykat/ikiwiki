The `progress` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/progress desc=progress]] plugin.

This directive generates a progress bar.

There are two possible parameter sets.  The first is a single parameter
"percent" which holds a percentage figure of how complete the progress bar is.

The second possible set of parameters is a pair of [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]]s,
`totalpages` and `donepages`. The directive counts the number of
pages in each pagespec and shows the percentage of the total pages that are
done.

For example, to show what percentage of pages have
discussion pages:

	\[[!progress totalpages="* and !*/Discussion" donepages="*/Discussion"]]

Rendering:
[[!progress  totalpages="* and !*/Discussion" donepages="*/Discussion"]]

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
