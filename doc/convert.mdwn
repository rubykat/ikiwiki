Do you have an existing wiki or blog using other software, and would like
to convert it to ikiwiki? Various tools and techniques have been developed
to handle such conversions.

* [[tips/convert_mediawiki_to_ikiwiki]]
* [[tips/convert_moinmoin_to_ikiwiki]]
* [[tips/convert_blogger_blogs_to_ikiwiki]]
* [[tips/Movable_Type_to_ikiwiki]]
* [[tips/convert_textpattern_to_ikiwiki]]
* [[tips/convert_drupal_to_ikiwiki]]

In addition, [[JoshTriplett]] has written scripts to convert Twiki sites, see [his page](/users/JoshTriplett) for more information.

Also consider using [jekyll-import](http://import.jekyllrb.com/), which imports into [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com), granted, but it already supports a bunch of CMSes and the markdown syntax of Jekyll may just be compatible with your ikiwiki.
