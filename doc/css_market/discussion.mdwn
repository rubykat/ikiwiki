What is the correct way to install the .tmpl files? -- [[JosephTurian]]

How can I update a .css file uploaded to the CSS market?
My CSS has been updated to address comments (for the comments plugin), but I cannot find a way to update zack.css.
The most recent version is always available at: <http://git.upsilon.cc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=zack-homepage.git;a=blob_plain;f=local.css;hb=HEAD>

Added small changes to embeddedmoose.css to work with ikiwiki 3.x.  Figured here is as good as any until Josh can review and update if he so chooses:  <http://bosboot.org/tb-embeddedmoose.css>.  It removes annoying borders around the header and footer.  -- [[TimBosse]]

I removed this from the list since both places to download it are broken.

  You can see it [here](http://fred.ccheznous.org). You can download the local.css file and
  the modified templates [here](http://fred.ccheznous.org/refresh_20060602.tgz).

    * This link (above) seems to deliver an empty tarball.

    * You'll find a updated version of these templates [here](http://www.der-winnie.de/~winnie/configs/ikiwiki-templates.tar.gz). 
       These templates are known to work with ikiwiki 2.31, and since I'll install always the newest one on my server I'll will update them on a regular basis.

Perhaps suggesting people make a new page with their css code in it on ikiwiki.info/css market/ to link to would avoid dead links in the future?
