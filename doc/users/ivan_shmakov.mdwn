&hellip; To put it short: an Ikiwiki newbie.

## Wikis

Currently, I run a few Ikiwiki instances.  Namely:

* <http://sfd.am-1.org/>
  &mdash; [Software Freedom Day][]
  event at [Altai State University][].

* <https://spire.am-1.org/>
  &mdash; introductory materials
  on XML, Markdown, Ikiwiki, etc.
  in Russian.

* <http://am-1.org/~ivan/networks-2011/>
  &mdash; bits &amp; pieces related to the course on computer
  networks I've read in 2011.

* http://rsdesne.am-1.org/rsdesne-2010/
  **(down since December, 2012)**
  &mdash; used to hold some of the materials related to the
  &ldquo;Remote Sensing in Education, Science and National
  Economy&rdquo; (2010-03-29 &hellip; 2010-04-10, Altai State
  University) program I've participated in as
  an instructor.

* http://lhc.am-1.org/lhc/
  **(down since December, 2012)**
  &mdash; used to hold random stuff written by me, my colleagues,
  students, etc.

## Preferences

I prefer to use [Lynx][] along with [Emacs][] (via
`emacsclient`) to work with the wikis.  (Note the &ldquo;Local
variables&rdquo; section below.)

The things I dislike in the wiki engines are:

* the use of home-brew specialized version control systems
  &mdash; while there're a lot of much more developed general
  purpose ones;

* oversimplified syntax
  &mdash; which (to some extent) precludes more sophisticated
  forms of automated processing; in particular, this forces one
  to reformat the material, once complete, to, say, prepare a
  book, or an article, or slides.

Out of all the wiki engines I'm familiar with, only Ikiwiki is
free of the first of these.  I hope that it will support more
elaborate syntaxes eventually.
