Georg's [homepage](http://jorge.at.anteris.net/)

Georg is operating [MagmaSoft](http://magma-soft.at) where he is
using ikiwiki on several websites.

Ikiwiki projects, all to be documented here:

- Location aware setup files for ikiwiki.
- Alternate dead simple multilingual support.
- An Ikiwiki local style sheet with dead simple responsive design oriented to optimized reading, see [this post](http://at.magma-soft.at/sw/blog/posts/Simple_Responsive_Design_for_IkiWiki/)
- [Microformats 2](http://microformats.org) support for Ikiwiki blogs,
  see [this post](http://at.magma-soft.at/sw/blog/posts/Microformats_for_IkiWiki/)
  for a first intro.
- The former is currently based on an approach to allow page metadata
  to be imported into the [[plugins/template]] and the [[plugins/inline]] page
  processing.
