Just started learning Ikiwiki...

I have been using [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) for a long time, now I would like to switch to [Ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/) because of:

+ git backend
+ MarkDown syntax

I have browsed <http://www.wikimatrix.org/compare/ikiwiki+MediaWiki>, but I am still not sure about which useful features (if any) I would miss from MediaWiki...

So the best way is actually trying it, isn't it?

I would also try integrating Ikiwiki with [Infinote](http://infinote.org/) (or perhaps [jinfinote](http://www.jinfinote.com/)), in order to allow concurrent editing of pages.
