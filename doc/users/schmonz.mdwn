* a undergraduate group's university-provided-static-hosted site
  (with [[plugins/rsync]] and a [WIND
  authentication](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/rad/authmethods/wind/)
  plugin)
* a major open-source project's wiki (with the [[rcs/cvs]] plugin)
* team documentation and project planning at work: product and
  sprint backlogs, burndown charts, release plans/procedures/announcements,
  aggregating feeds of shared interest, etc. (with the
  [[plugins/contrib/dynamiccookies]] and [[plugins/contrib/proxies]]
  plugins)
* personal to-do and scratch space
