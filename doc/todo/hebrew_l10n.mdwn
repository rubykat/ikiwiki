Ikiwiki already has localizations for several languages, but not for Hebrew.
Hebrew is also special, being a right-to-left language (same is true for Arabic
and several others). I hope the page template localizations can handle the
layout direction issues and make the whole wiki HTML to be right-to-left.

Anyway, I started preparing a Hebrew localization. Just wanted to say it here
to avoid duplication, and to let the developers/maintainers know in case it
matters.
