Some time ago I asked in the [[ikiwiki forum|http://ikiwiki.info/forum/Wikilink_to_a_symbolic_link/]] how to create wikilinks to symbolic links. The answer was that this is not possible because of security reasons.

However I use ikiwiki only locally for my personal use. So it wouldn't be a security issue for me. The point is, that I want to link to pdf-files that are somewhere on my harddrive because I want to have automatically the newest versions of the files linked to in my ikiwiki. So my idea would be to create a symbolic links to those files in my scrdir.

Would be great if something like that would be possible soon.
