(This conversation was moved from [[plugins/wmd/discussion]]. --[[anarcat]])

I've tried to retrieve the wmd-editor source tarball lately, but the site seems offline.

From what I've read on the Internet, wmd-editor is not (yet?) free software by itself, and its author has gone MIA.
But it looks like somebody recently took the step to rewrite a wmd-clone under a saner license, see [[pagedown|http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/source/browse/]].

Given all the above, what about upgrading this plugin to use pagedown instead of wmd? It seem a clear win to me...

>> Showdown has a pretty explicit [license.txt file](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown/blob/master/license.txt)

>> 
>> I agree the license behind WMD is murky. One the one hand, the [google code page](https://code.google.com/p/wmd/)

>>

>>     deployed massively on farms without user intervention.
>>  3. on large pages, the edit screen isn't in the first screen, so it's not 
>>     obvious we're editing the page, which is also a little confusing - we

>>      ideally, we would show the edit box next to the page preview... And there's a way to do that too! But it requires some more CSS hackery, like [this](http://css-tricks.com/scrollfollow-sidebar/), for example:
