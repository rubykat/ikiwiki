[[!tag wishlist]]

[My ikiwiki instance](http://www.ipol.im/) is quite heavy. 674M of data in the source repo, 1.1G in its .git folder.
Lots of \[[!img ]] (~2200), lots of \[[!teximg ]] (~2700). A complete rebuild takes 10 minutes.

We could use a big machine, with plenty of CPUs. Could some multi-threading support be added to ikiwiki, by forking out all the external heavy  plugins (imagemagick, tex, ...) and/or by processing pages in parallel?

Disclaimer: I know nothing of the Perl approach to parallel processing.
