As requested per IRC:

    18:07:32  * RichiH notes (again) that if ikiwiki produced html which fit the common template standards, there would be hundreds of high quality templates there for the taking ;)
    18:09:47 < smcv> RichiH: where by "common template standards" you mean "something specific to bootstrap"?
    18:10:05 < smcv> or is there an actual standard with some sort of spec, a la microformats?
    18:32:16 < RichiH> smcv: all the free webdesign sites have one shared format
    18:32:48 < RichiH> iirc, there's a patchset for ikiwiki. again iirc, it was already old by debconf13 when we discussed that
    18:35:16 < smcv> RichiH: please point me to something I can review, I'll try to look at it
    18:35:40 < smcv> RichiH: also please point to something resembling a specification so I can tell whether the patchset is appropriate
    18:36:12 < smcv> RichiH: you certainly didn't discuss anything with me at dc13, I haven't been to a debconf since 7 :-)
    18:38:57 < RichiH> smcv: we discussed it with joeyh 
    18:39:04 < RichiH> i forgot the name of the other guy with the patch series
    18:39:39 < RichiH> http://penta.debconf.org/dc13_schedule/events/1060.en.html should have interesting bits and pieces
    18:42:37 < smcv> please open a todo on ikiwiki.info?
    18:42:53 < smcv> sorry, I am not going to remember this when not at work

I think it was anarcat who had the patches

I've started [yet another bootstrap theme](https://notabug.org/iikb/ikiwiki-theme-bootstrap). The main reason being because I wanted a theme that actually worked within the [[theme plugin|/plugins/theme]] without changing anything else, and [[I've made it|/forum/bootstrap_theme]]. --[[desci]]
