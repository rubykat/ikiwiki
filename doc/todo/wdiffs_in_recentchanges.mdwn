Would be nice if the recentchangesdiff plugin could optionally provide wdiffs, or highlight the changes on each line. When people edit a wiki via the web interface, they often put each paragraph on a single line, like this one, and if someone later edits the paragraph, the diff only shows the whole line changed, making it difficult to figure out what the actual change is. --liw
