I don't necessarily trust all OpenID providers to stop bots.  I note that ikiwiki allows [[banned_users]], and that there are other todos such as [[todo/openid_user_filtering]] that would extend this.  However, it might be nice to have a CAPTCHA system.

I imagine a plugin that modifies the login screen to use <http://recaptcha.net/>.  You would then be required to fill in the captcha as well as log in in the normal way.

Okie - I have a first pass of this.  There are still some issues.

Currently the code verifies the CAPTCHA.  If you get it right then you're fine.
If you get the CAPTCHA wrong then the current code tells formbuilder that
one of the fields is invalid.  This stops the login from going through.
Unfortunately, formbuilder is caching this validity somewhere, and I haven't
found a way around that yet.  This means that if you get the CAPTCHA
wrong, it will continue to fail.  You need to load the login page again so
it doesn't have the error message on the screen, then it'll work again.

> fixed this - updated code is attached.

A second issue is that the OpenID login system resets the 'required' flags
of all the other fields, so using OpenID will cause the CAPTCHA to be
ignored.

(code snipped as a working [[patch]] is below)

Instructions
=====

You need to go to <http://recaptcha.net/api/getkey> and get a key set.
The keys are added as options.

	reCaptchaPubKey => "LONGPUBLICKEYSTRING",
	reCaptchaPrivKey => "LONGPRIVATEKEYSTRING",

You can also use "signInSSL" if you're using ssl for your login screen.


The following code is just inline.  It will probably not display correctly, and you should just grab it from the page source.
