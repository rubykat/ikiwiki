[[!tag patch]]

the inline plugin's sorting is plain lexical, thich may not be appropriate for
page titles if they have numeric components. the
[Sort::Naturally](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Sort-Naturally/) perl module
provides an algorithm for that.

there is a
patch 55b83cb7bd1cd7c60bb45dc22c3745dd80a63fed
attached that makes the [[plugins/inline]] plugin use Sort::Naturally if sort
is set to "title_natural".

the current patch uses `require Sort::Naturally`, so
[libsort-naturally-perl](http://packages.debian.org/libsort-naturally-perl)
does not become a dependency; it might be worth suggesting, though.
