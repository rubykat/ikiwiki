I've prepared a bootstrap branch based on
<https://github.com/gsliepen/ikistrap>. 

Main impediment to merging it is jquery; bootstrap probably needs
a newer version than the 1.6.2 included in ikiwiki and upgrading
it would need testing the parts of ikiwiki that use jquery.

It also needs to include bootstrap 4 in ikiwiki, rather than pulling
it from the CDN, probably. Although depending on a debian package
would be nicer, if bootstrap 4 got packaged in Debian.

Note that the template changes are not entirely optimial, but I
did them in a way that makes the diff pretty clear that nothing changes
except when the bootstrap theme is enabled.
