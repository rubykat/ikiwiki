Some time ago there was a [[question|http://ikiwiki.info/forum/how_to_get_nice_pdf_from_ikiwiki_pages__63__/?updated#comment-05381634f89629ad26298a1af4b1d5f9]] in the forum how to get a nice pdf output from an ikiwiki page. However there were no answers. So I put it on the todo list, because I think this would be a nice feature.

Note that for example dokuwiki has a [[nice plugin|http://danjer.doudouke.org/tech/dokutexit]] which converts the wiki page to latex and then to pdf and you can customize the latex-preamble.

> I've actually written one, it's just not publicly released.  You can check it out from the "experimental" branch of my <a href="https://github.com/rubykat/ikiplugins">ikiplugins githup repo</a>.  It's called "html2pdf" and it depends on the static version of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/">wkhtmltopdf</a> rather than requiring a whole LaTeX setup. It's only been used on Ubuntu, so I can't say what problems there might be on other setups, but it works for me.  It's not properly documented; I'd appreciate some help with that.
