[[!meta title="Javascript equivalent of plugin 'calendar'"]]
[[!tag patch]]

Hello,
we ([[Gr√©sille|http://www.gresille.org]]) have a calendar (built using the [[calendar|plugins/calendar]] plugin) in the sidebar of our website. This caused the whole website to be rebuilded each night, and we did not like it. So I wrote a javascript equivalent of the calendar plugin.

Here are the differences compared to the [[calendar|plugins/calendar]] plugin.

* Pros
  * No need to rebuild the page containing the calendar each time day changes, or
    a page (indexed by the calendar) is added, changed or deleted. This is
    particularly useful if you want to have this calendar in the sidebar.
  * Handles the case where several pages appear the same day: a popup appear to let user choose the day he wants.
  * Smooth navigation among months.
* Neutral
  * Most of options are defined in Ikiwiki's setup files instead of the options
    of the directive.
* Cons
  * As a consequence, every calendar of the wiki must index the same set of pages.
  * Javascript :( .

You can see this plugin in action on [[our website|http://www.gresille.org]]. To see what happens when several pages happens on the same day, check the 15th of March 2012.

I do not know how contributions are processed, but if you want to include this plugin in Ikiwiki, I made a copy of Ikiwiki repository, with this new plugin (as well as the documentation for the plugin and the directive).
