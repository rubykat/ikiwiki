[[!template id=gitbranch branch=wtk/mdwn_itex author="[[wtk]]"]]

summary
=======

Extend the [[plugins/mdwn]] plugin to support [itex][] using Jacques
Distler's [itex2MML][].

notes
=====

This is an updated form of [[users/JasonBlevins]]' plugin.  You can
see the plugin [in action][example] on my blog.  The blog post lists a
few additional changes you may need to make to use the plugin,
including changing your page template to a MathML-friendly doctype and
disabling plugins like [[plugins/htmlscrubber]] and
[[plugins/htmltidy]] which would otherwise strip out the generated
MathML.
