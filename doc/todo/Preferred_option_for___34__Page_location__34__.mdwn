It looks like the auto-generated options for "Page location" are:

 * enforced_lowercase
 * Capitals_As_Typed
 * subpage/enforced_lowercase
 * subpage/Capitals_As_Typed

And the default option is `Capitals_As_Typed`. If it isn't already possible (and I've just missed it), could future version allow the admin to pick which of these is the default? (I'd prefer `subpage/enforced_lowercase`)
