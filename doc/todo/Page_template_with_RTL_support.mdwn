Hi,

I've modified page.tmpl to take into account rtl languages. Basically I've modified the `<html>` tag to generate

	<html dir="$DIRECTION" lang="$LANG">

if the PO plugin is enabled.

I can't seem to attach a patch - sending it to Joey.
Copy pasting markup here seems to be quite problematic.

Cheers.
