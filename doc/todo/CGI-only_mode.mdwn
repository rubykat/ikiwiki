[[!tag wishlist]]I would quite like to be able to run ikiwiki in a "CGI-only" mode, where
every wikilink was routed via the cgi, and such "normal" page visits were rendered on the
fly by the CGI, a bit like edit-preview mode.

The reason I'd like this is I would like to have a number of parallel ikiwiki instances
running alongside my prime one, based on the same source repository; but with different
setup parameters (such as possibly different overlay or template directories, etc.).

I would still need to have multiple copies of the source repository (= separate `.ikiwiki`
directories, seperate locks); but I could use `git-relink` or shallow clones or various
other methods to limit the disk-space impact of that; what I want to avoid is multiple
*destination* directories, especially for what might be relatively throw-away experiments.

I imagine if this was possible, it would be hella-slow, but it would still be useful I
think (and might even help to highlight some of the pain points for future optimisation
efforts).
