So this is a little nutty [[wishlist]].

There's this cool software called [Bugs Everywhere](http://bugseverywhere.org/) (be) which allows you to track your bug reports as plain text files in git.

There's also an "html" command for be that allows you to produce an HTML rendering of the repository.

ikiwiki could detect and use that instead of the (fairly limited) [[tips/integrated_issue_tracking_with_ikiwiki]].. --[[anarcat]]
