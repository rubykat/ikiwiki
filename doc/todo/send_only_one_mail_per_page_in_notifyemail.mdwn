[[!tag wishlist]]

[[!template  id=gitbranch branch=anarcat/notify_one_email author="[[anarcat]]"]]

While working on [[todo/option to send only the diff in notifyemail]], I tried to improve the [[plugins/notifyemail]] plugin to make it send only one email per change instead of one email per file changed. When using the wiki through git, this is particularly important if people touch a lot of pages at the same time.

The [[!taglink patch]], incomplete and buggy, is in my `notify_one_email` branch. --[[anarcat]]
