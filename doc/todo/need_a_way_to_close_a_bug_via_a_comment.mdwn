When ikiwiki is being used for issue tracking, it would be convenient to
have a way to close a bug from a comment, rather than editing the bug
report page in a wiki-manner.

So, some way to set a tag from a comment, such that it applies to the
parent page.

Turning on allowdirectives may make that work (I have not tried), but
it's probably too heavyweight/intrusive/possible a security issue.

Maybe extend the comment directive with a field to set/unset tags?
