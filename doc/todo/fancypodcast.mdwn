## Future improvements

### iTunes fancy podcasting

* [iTunes-specific tags](https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html)
  appear to be RSS-only
    * If they work in Atom, teach `inline` to optionally iTunesify RSS/Atom.
    * Else, add `itunes` as a third kind of feed (RSS plus more stuff).
* Notable tags for feeds:
    * `itunes:subtitle`
    * `itunes:author`
    * `itunes:summary` (same as `description`)
    * `itunes:owner` (includes `itunes:name` and `itunes:email`)
    * `itunes:image href=''`
    * `itunes:publisher`
    * `itunes:category text=''` (can contain subcategories)
    * `itunes:keywords`
* Notable tags for entries:
    * `itunes:duration`
        * [[!cpan Audio::TagLib]] might be fastest, if present and applicable
        * [ffprobe](http://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) is reasonably fast
        * [mediainfo](http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/) is way slower
        * Cache computed durations as pagestate

### Fancy podcast aggregating

* Write tests comparing a fancy podcast (HTML and feeds) against
  the same podcast aggregated and republished, then make them pass
  via changes to `aggregatepost.impl` and [[plugins/aggregate]].

### Other ideas

* Optionally specify the enclosure's:
    * MIME type, in case `File::MimeInfo` guesses wrong.
    * Duration, in case `ffprobe` guesses wrong.
* Optionally specify enclosures outside the wiki:
    * Some people don't want to store big unchanging files in the VCS.
    * Other people like [podcasting found media](http://huffduffer.com/about).
    * We'd have to download the file just to compute some metadata
      about it, and then somehow not frequently re-download it.
* Configurably generate additional subscription links (such as
  iTunes) alongside the RSS/Atom ones in [[plugins/inline]].
* Support Apple's "enhanced podcasts" (if they're still relevant).
