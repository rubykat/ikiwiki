There is no tag for the Debian release numbered: 3.20141016.3. it *seems* like it should be the head of the debian-jessie branch (51b4083). I can't seem to push the tag myself. --[[anarcat]]

> [[Now pushed|done]]. I didn't want to tag 3.20141016.3 while there was a chance

> different suites since Friday, three of which need someone else's
> approval before they're finalized, so please excuse delays to the
