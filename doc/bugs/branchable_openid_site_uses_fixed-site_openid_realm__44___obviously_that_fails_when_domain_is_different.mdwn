phil hands is kindly hosting rhombus-tech.net on an h-branchable ikiwiki.  openid has been enabled, for convenience.  unfortunately... :/etc/ikiwiki-hosting/ikiwiki-hosting.conf has an openid realm of "http://*.hands.com" which is kinda important (i assume) for security reasons.  however this conflicts with what openid requires.  openid logins are now specifying the realm of http://*.hands.com which of course doesn't match with http://rhombus-tech.net - it all goes pear-shaped from there.

any ideas?  thanks folks.
