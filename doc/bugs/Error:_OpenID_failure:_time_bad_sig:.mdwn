Sometimes when I try to login (to edit a page) here then I can see
the following error message:

    Error: OpenID failure: time_bad_sig:

Please note that authorization process successes on OpenID server side.

It occurs both for [getopenid.com](http://www.getopenid.com/)
and [myopenid.com](http://www.myopenid.com/) servers I use.

I'm reporting this, but I'm not sure whether a problem is with your
ikiwiki or my OpenID servers. --[[PaweÅ‚|ptecza]]

		return $self->_fail("time_in_future") if $sig_time - 30 > $now;
		# and check that the time isn't faked
		my $c_secret = $self->_get_consumer_secret($sig_time);
		my $good_sig = substr(OpenID::util::hmac_sha1_hex($sig_time, $c_secret), 0, 20);
		return $self->_fail("time_bad_sig") unless $sig eq $good_sig;

I've had this problem too, but with my track record of reporting OpenID bugs 
I thought it best if I held my tongue. I usually experience this the first
time I sign in on any ikiwiki installation of {ikiwiki.kitenet, ikidev, 
betacantrips}, and I think re-logging in always works. --Ethan

## the return of the nasty bug

Hmmmmm, looks like it is not entirely fixed.  I am getting it on my own
[blog](http://blog.tobez.org/).  Just upgraded to 3.20110430, same same.
I am using custom openid with redirection to myopenid.com.
Please tell me if you need more info.  The same openid worked fine to login to *this* site to post this.

I am getting the same error here with ikiwiki 3.20120629 (wheezy). I had trouble with ikiwiki-hosting configurations of OpenID, basically related to the `openid_realm` parameter - which I had to comment out. But now it seems to fail regardless. --[[anarcat]]
