Saw a site using the po plugin crash with:

	syntax error in pagespec "\"page(./tips/*)"

I suspect the relevant configuration is this:

	po_translatable_pages: /index or /hugo or /hugo/keys or /about or /archive or /tips
	  or /talks or /imprint or /copyright or /blog or /posts  or /law or /quotes or /quotes/*

Config problems in ikiwiki.setup should really not cause the whole site
build to crash; this can make it hard to recover. --[[Joey]]

I try to setup a small site with the auto-blog.setup and played a bit with it:
If I activate the po plugin and set po_translateable_pages to something meaningful (like the example: `* and !*/Discussion`),
then I'll get the same error

    syntax error in pagespec "\"page(./posts/*)"

but only after a second run of the ikiwiki --setup site.setup

My try to get a clue: deleting any po and pot files and run the rebuild again - works fine  
run the rebuild a second time - error as above

tune any of the pagespec variables in the setup and at the inline directives of the blog or sidebar dosn't change anything
except leaving the po_translateable_pages empty, than the rebuild works and doesn't create any po files (as expected).

Is this helpful or have I done anything stupid ? -- Michael
