Under some circumstances that remain unclear to me, the usage of `urlto()` in the revised version of the [[plugins/osm]] plugin break the map totally. The javascript console in Chromium tells me the following:

    GET http://mesh.openisp.ca/map/pois.kml/ 404 (Not Found)

Indeed, that URL yields a 404. The proper URL is <http://mesh.openisp.ca/map/pois.kml>. --[[anarcat]]
