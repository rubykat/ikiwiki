On my [blog](http://anarc.at/blog), i have setup a simple calendar and sparkline on the sidebar, similar to [joey's](http://joeyh.name/blog/). Unfortunately, in my case it looks like all posts were done in february, date at which i [converted from drupal](http://anarc.at/blog/2015-02-06-migrating-drupal-ikiwiki/).

This is how i did the directives:

<pre>
\[[!calendar pages="blog/* and !blog/*/* and !*/Discussion"]]

\[[!calendar pages="blog/* and !blog/*/* and !*/Discussion" month=-1]]

Temps pass√© entre les articles: 
\[[!postsparkline pages="blog/* and !blog/*/* and !link(foo) and
!link(unfinished)" max=50
formula=interval style=bar barwidth=2 barspacing=1 height=13]]  
Articles par mois:
\[[!postsparkline pages="blog/* and !blog/*/* and !link(foo) and
!link(unfinished)" max=23 formula=permonth style=bar barwidth=2 barspacing=1 height=13]]  
</pre>

Is it possible the `meta(date)` directives are being ignored by those plugins? --[[anarcat]]
