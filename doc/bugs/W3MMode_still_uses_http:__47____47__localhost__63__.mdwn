My setup matches w3mmode [[w3mmode/ikiwiki.setup]] exactly.
My doc/index.mdwn just has a line or two of plain text.
When I try to edit that page in w3m, it works fine until I push [Save Page].
Then I just get a page that only contains "403".

ikiwiki version is 3.20110715ubuntu1.
w3m is 0.5.3.

I made it work, though probably not completely, by renaming
~/.ikiwiki/wrappers/ikiwiki.cgi to ikiwiki2.cgi and replacing it with:

    #!/bin/bash
    /home/tjgolubi/.ikiwiki/wrappers/ikiwiki2.cgi $* | sed -e 's,http://localhost,file://,g'

I'm afraid that this hack may have bad side-effects, but I hope it points you to the cause/solution.
Of course, the next time I rerun ikiwiki --setup, it will overwrite my wrapper-wrapper.

I made a logfile of all the args, env, and stdin/stdout to/from my wrapper.  If you're interested, I'll email it to you.  I wasn't able to attach it here.
