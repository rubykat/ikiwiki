I'm getting this error message when I refresh my wiki:

But there is no error if I use `ikiwiki --rebuild` to regenerate the whole thing.

>> I'm sorry, I don't know what I was thinking there.  It's ikiwiki 3.20100212, and manually applying the patch you linked to made the bug go away.  (Upgrading ikiwiki is a pain on nearlyfreespeech, especially if you don't want to keep the build directory around -- please consider making ikiwiki runnable directly from a git clone.)
