Hi! While working on Reproducible Builds for Tails, we noticed that
the pagestats plugin's output is not deterministic: pages that have
the same number of hits (counts) are sorted in hash order.

The `pagestats-determinism` branch in the
<https://git-tails.immerda.ch/ikiwiki.git> Git repository has a fix
for this problem.
