I suppose this isn't technically a bug, but whetever.

I want symbolic links to be rendered as HTTP redirects. For example,
if we do this,

    touch foo.mkdwn
    ln -s foo.mkdwn bar.mkdwn
    git push baz.branchable.com

then the following command should print 302

    curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}" http://baz.thomaslevine.com/bar/
