A simple use of this plugin seems to fail now,
yeilding either a blank map or some javascript errors.

The javascript errors I saw are:

	SyntaxError: syntax error
	OpenLayers.js (line 476, col 64)

	ReferenceError: OpenLayers is not defined
	osm.js (line 30, col 1)

> I guess OpenLayers made a backwards-incompatible change... At [reseaulibre](http://wiki.reseaulibre.ca/) it seems we have survived this because we have a local copy of the OpenLayers source code:
> 
>         osm_openlayers_url: http://wiki.reseaulibre.ca/OpenLayers-2.12/OpenLayers.js
>
> Try specifying a versionned URL for the source:
>
>         osm_openlayers_url: http://openlayers.org/api/2.12/OpenLayers.js
> 
> ... and see if that fixes the problem. Then we can start looking at the [release notes](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/blob/master/notes/2.13.md) to figure out what change they did that broke us and upgrade. Or pin the version on our side. Or simply [[switch to something else|todo/replace_openlayers_with_leaflet]]. --[[anarcat]]
