Hello,

does anyone have an idea why I see the following error when I run websetup (Setup button in Preferences)?

    Error: Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Plugin/websetup.pm line 82, line 97.

Maybe, related to this is also

    $ ikiwiki --setup /etc/ikiwiki/auto-blog.setup
    What will the blog be named? tmpblog
    What revision control system to use? git
    What wiki user (or openid) will be admin? wsh

           ikiwiki --setup configfile

I'm on Debian unstable.

Thanks,
