On Line #46 of the `bzr` plugin there's a mistalke. Instead of:

    my @cmdline = ("bzr", $config{srcdir}, "update");

It should be:

    my @cmdline = ("bzr", "update", $config{srcdir});

The former produces errors such as "_bzr: ERROR: unknown command "/home/user/ikiwiki/posts_", "_'bzr /home/user/ikiwiki/posts update' failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Rcs/bzr.pm line 48._".
