When I run `ikiwiki` with the ``--rebuild`` option (or only with the `--setup file.setup` option a map directive like `\[[!map  pages="*" show=title]]` generates a page map as if it didn't contain any `show` parameter. Only after I manually edit something which causes the page containing the map directive to be rebuilt is the page map regenerated without ignoring the `show` parameter.
