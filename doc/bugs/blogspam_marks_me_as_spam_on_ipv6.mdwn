I just got this message trying to post to this wiki:

    Error: Sorry, but that looks like spam to blogspam: No reverse DNS entry for 2001:1928:1:9::1

So yeah, it seems I have no reverse DNS for my IPv6 address, which may
be quite common for emerging IPv6 deployments...

This may be related to [[blogspam_options whitelist vs. IPv6?]].
