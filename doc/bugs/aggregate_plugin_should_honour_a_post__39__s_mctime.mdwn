It would be nice if the [[aggregate_plugin|plugins/aggregate]] would try to
extract the m/ctime out of each post and touch the files on the filesystem
appropriately, so that ikiwiki reflects the actual time of the post via the
[[inline_plugin|plugins/inline]], rather than the time when the aggregation ran to pull the post in. --[[madduck]]

	# Set the mtime, this lets the build process get the right creation
	# time on record for the new page.
	utime $mtime, $mtime, pagefile($guid->{page})
		if defined $mtime && $mtime <= time;
