when enabling the cgi wrapper I get,


generating wrappers..
"/var/www/cgi-bin/ikiwiki.cgi.c", line 91: warning: implicit function declaration: flock
"/var/www/cgi-bin/ikiwiki.cgi.c", line 91: undefined symbol: LOCK_EX

I don't know enough C to provide a patch, but from googling it, people seem to be suggesting fcntl has an alternative.

changing

    if (lockfd != -1 && flock(lockfd, LOCK_EX) == 0) {
   

to read

    if (lockfd != -1 && lockf(lockfd, F_LOCK,0) == 0) {


in IkiWiki/Wrapper.pm  lets it compile, according to http://man-wiki.net/index.php/3:lockf "On  Linux, this call is just an interface for fcntl(2)"  does this seem like a sensible fix?
