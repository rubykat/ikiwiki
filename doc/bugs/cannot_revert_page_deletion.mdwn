After deleting a page with the "remove" button, it seems that the page deletion cannot be reverted using the "revert" icon in [[RecentChanges]]. 
It ironically says that "Error: ?$pagename does not exist". See [[http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki.cgi?rev=860c2c84d98ea0a38a4f91dacef6d4e09f6e6c2e&do=revert]]. [[JeanPrivat]]

> The root bug is that git's `rcs_preprevert` creates a structure that

> not the change that would be made if it was reverted (which includes a
> file addition). [[Fixed|done]]. --[[Joey]]
