I just tried to clone the git repo onto a windows machine to test things out a bit and it turns out i cannot even successfully checkout the code because of those colons. Would a patch changing those to underscores be accepted? --Mithaldu

>> I'm not trying to run it there. Ikiwiki is way too friggin' weird to try that. I just want to be able to check out the main repo so i can work in a native editor. Right now your core repository is downright hostile to cross-platform development in any way, shape or form. (Just plain splitting the docs from the code would work too.) --Mithaldu
