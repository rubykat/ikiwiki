I can't seem to do a password reset on this wiki. I am writing this
through the anonymous git push interface (phew for that!).

I have tried three times now to reset my password through the user
interface - my account name is [[anarcat]], and when i do the password
reset, I get a token. I go visit the website, set a passphrase, click
`Save Preferences` and I end up on a login form. I enter my
passphrase, click `Login` and I get the error:

    1 error(s) were encountered with your submission. Please correct the fields highlighted below.
    
    Name
    [anarcat]
    
    Password
    [*************] Invalid entry

`Password` is highlighted.

Even if I leave the password there (my cleartext password is in the
login form by default after the password reset, which is strange), it
still gives me that error. -- [[anarcat]]
