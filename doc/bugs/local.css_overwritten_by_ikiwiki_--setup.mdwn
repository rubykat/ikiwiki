Steps to reproduce:

 * Running ikiwiki 3.20130904.1ubuntu1 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 * Modify `~/public_html/MYWIKI/local.css`
 * Run `ikiwiki --setup MYWIKI.setup` (or update via websetup interface)

What should happen:

 * Setup is updated/site is rebuilt
 * local.css is retained and used

What happens instead:

 * Setup is updated (works)
 * local.css reverts to blank version

Workaround:

 * Create mylocal.css, and manually copy it over local.css every time

> This is [[working as intended|done]]. IkiWiki is a wiki compiler: everything

> (probably `~/MYWIKI`) and commit it to the VCS, or enable the
> [[plugins/attachment]] plugin and "attach" it to the top-level `index` page.
> IkiWiki will copy it into the `$destdir` whenever it changes. --[[smcv]]
