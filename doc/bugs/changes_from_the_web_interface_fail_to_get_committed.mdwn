For some reason, on a wiki hosted locally using [ikiwiki-hosting](http://ikiwiki-hosting.branchable.com), web edits do not get committed and pushed to the central repository anymore.

For example, I just did an edit on the web interface, which went on without error, but then the modified files are not committed:

[[!format txt """
o-cats@marcos:~/source$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   2014/summer.mdwn
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
"""]]

The files and the .cgi are owned by the right user:

[[!format txt """
o-cats@marcos:~/source$ ls -al 2014/summer.mdwn
-rw-r--r-- 1 o-cats o-cats 2812 Nov 28 23:35 2014/summer.mdwn
o-cats@marcos:~/source$ ls -al  /var/www/o-cats/ikiwiki.cgi
-rwxr-xr-x 1 o-cats o-cats 15596 Oct  4 12:16 /var/www/o-cats/ikiwiki.cgi
"""]]

The virtual host is configured to run as the right user:

[[!format txt """

        ServerName foo.example.com

What's going on all of a sudden? This is Debian wheezy. --[[anarcat]]
