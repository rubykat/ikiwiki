I was thinking about using ikiwiki for a project I'm working on and was testing to see how fast the project loaded when I came across this error while testing the ikiwiki website using <https://www.dotcom-tools.com/website-speed-test.aspx>
It said the following element was not found:
Url: <https://ikiwiki.info/wikiicons/email.png>
<https://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki.cgi?do=prefs>

> [[fixed|done]] --[[smcv]]
