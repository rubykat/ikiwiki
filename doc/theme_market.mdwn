[[!meta title="Theme Market" description="user-contributed themes for ikiwiki"]]

This is a directory of user-contributed ikiwiki themes. For more information about themes, see the [[plugins/theme]] page.

It is usually preferable (and more maintainable) to create a [[css]] file instead of a full theme, but sometimes the HTML produced by ikiwiki just isn't compatible with your template, so you need to modify the templates provided. This is when you need to make your own theme.

Feel free to add your own [[theme|themes]] here, but first consider writing a simpler [[css]] file and adding it to the [[css market]] instead, or look at the [[themes]] shipped with ikiwiki.

* **[AntPortal theme](https://github.com/AntPortal/ikiwiked)**, contributed by Danny, see an example [on the Antportal wiki](https://antportal.com/wiki/)

* **[Night city theme](http://anarcat.ath.cx/night_city/README/)**, contributed by [[anarcat]].

* **[Bootstrap theme](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/jak/website.git;a=summary)**, contributed by [JAK LINUX](http://jak-linux.org/about/), based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), [modifications available](https://anarc.at/blog/2015-09-09-bootstrap/) from [[anarcat]] as well

  * [Yet another bootstrap theme](https://notabug.org/iikb/ikiwiki-theme-bootstrap), this one can be used like a regular theme by placing [the theme files](https://notabug.org/iikb/ikiwiki-theme-bootstrap/archive/1.0.0.25.zip) on `/usr/share/ikiwiki/themes/bootstrap/` and changing the `theme` configuration to `boostrap`.

* **[Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/ramseydsilva/ikiwiki-bootstrap-theme)**, contributed by [[ramsey]], based on [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com). [Example](http://bootstrap-ramseydsilva.wiki.orangeseeds.org). This template has been forked and modified in many ways:

  * Modification for [dequis.org](https://github.com/dequis/ikiwiki-bootstrap-theme/tree/dequis.org). [Example](http://bootstrap-dequis.wiki.orangeseeds.org).

  * Modification to fix the sidebar: **[Bootstrap 2](https://notabug.org/hiatobr/ikiwiki-bootstrap-theme-2)**, contributed by [Hacklab IndependÃªncia](http://hi.ato.br). This one is hard translated to brazilian portuguese. [Example](http://bootstrap-hiatobr.wiki.orangeseeds.org).
