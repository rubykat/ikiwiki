A podcast is just a [[blog]] with RSS/Atom feeds containing media
enclosures. Once you've made a blog, ikiwiki gives you two ways to
turn it into a podcast.

## Basic podcasting

Put a media file where you'd put a blog post, and your `\[[!inline]]`
directive will include it as a media-only post.

## Fancier podcasting

Put the media file where `\[[!inline]]` _won't_ directly include it.
Write a blog post with `\[[!meta enclosure="WikiLink/to/media.mp3"]]`
and your show notes.
