# Vim and ikiwiki

## Syntax highlighting

[ikiwiki-syntax](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3156) is a vim
syntax highlighting file for ikiwiki [[ikiwiki/markdown]] files. It highlights
directives and wikilinks. It only supports prefixed directives, i.e.,
\[[!directive foo=bar baz]], not the old format with spaces.

------

The previous syntax definition for ikiwiki links is at [[vim_syntax_highlighting/ikiwiki.vim]]; however,
it seems to not be [[maintained
anymore|forum/navigation_of_wiki_pages_on_local_filesystem_with_vim#syn-maintenance]],
and it has some [[issues|forum/ikiwiki_vim_syntaxfile]].

## Page creation and navigation

The [ikiwiki-nav](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2968) package
is a vim plugin that enables you to do the following from inside vim:

  * Jumping to the file corresponding to the wikilink under the cursor.
  * Creating the file corresponding to the wikilink under the cursor (including
  directories if necessary.)
  * Jumping to the previous/next wikilink in the current file.
  * Autocomplete link names.
