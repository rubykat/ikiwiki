You've enabled the [[plugins/comments]] plugin, so a set of pages on your
blog can have comments added to them. Pages with comments even have special
feeds that can be used to subscribe to those comments. But you'd like to
add a feed that contains all the comments posted to any page. Here's how:

	\[[!inline pages="comment(*)" template=comment]]

The special [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] matches all comments. The
[[template|templates]] causes the comments to be displayed formatted
nicely.

It's also possible to make a feed of comments that are held pending
moderation.

	\[[!inline pages="comment_pending(*)" template=comment]]
