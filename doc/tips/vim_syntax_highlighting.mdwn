[ikiwiki-syntax](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3156) is a vim
syntax highlighting file for ikiwiki [[ikiwiki/markdown]] files. It highlights
directives and wikilinks. It only supports prefixed directives, i.e.,
\[[!directive foo=bar baz]], not the old format with spaces.

------

The previous syntax definition for ikiwiki links is at [[ikiwiki.vim]]; however,
it seems to not be [[maintained
anymore|forum/navigation_of_wiki_pages_on_local_filesystem_with_vim#syn-maintenance]],
and it has some [[issues|forum/ikiwiki_vim_syntaxfile]].
