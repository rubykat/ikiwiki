I have a [blog](http://git.kitenet.net/?p=joey/home.git;a=blob_plain;f=bin/blog)
program that I use to write blog posts in a text editor. The first line I
enter is used as the title, and it automatically comes up with a unique page
name based on the title and handles all the details of posting to my blog.
