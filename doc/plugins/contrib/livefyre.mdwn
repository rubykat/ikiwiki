[LiveFyre](http://www.livefyre.com) is a third party comment and discussion system similar in some ways to Disqus or IntenseDebate.  All three services use javascript to attach comments to your site without the need to use a native commenting system.  

This plugin is designed to replace the commenting system in IkiWiki entirely.  It embeds LiveFyre comments on your ikiwiki blog or posts.  It is was originally based on the [Disqus Plugin](https://code.google.com/p/ikiwiki-plugin-disqus/).  After a few days of noticing odd page title names on the livefyre moderation interface, I updated the script to make use of JSON.  I made extensive use of the [integration guide](https://github.com/Livefyre/livefyre-docs/wiki/StreamHub-Integration-Guide) to get it all running.

It's loud and messy and slow, but kind of neat too.

Requires the [[!cpan JSON]], [[!cpan JSON::WebToken]], and [[!cpan Digest::MD5]] perl modules to be available.

See the POD documention in the module for installation and configuration instructions.
