The `trailinline` directive is provided by the
[[!iki plugins/contrib/trail desc=trail]]
plugin. It is equivalent to combining [[ikiwiki/directive/trailitems]] and
[[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directives with the same options.

A typical use is to navigate through all posts in a blog:

      \[[!trailinline pages="page(./posts/*) and !*/Discussion" archive=yes
        feedshow=10 quick=yes]]

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
