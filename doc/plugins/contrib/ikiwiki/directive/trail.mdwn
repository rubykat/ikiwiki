The `trail` directive is supplied by the
[[!iki plugins/contrib/trail desc=trail]] plugin. It sets options for the
trail represented by this page, and can also add pages to the trail. Example usage:

    \[[!trail sort="meta(title)" circular="no"]]

The available options are:

* `pages`: adds pages that match a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] to the trail

* `pagenames`: adds a space-separated list of pages to the trail,
  with the same [[SubPage/LinkingRules]] as for a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]]

* `sort`: sets a [[ikiwiki/pagespec/sorting]] order; if not specified, the
  items of the trail are ordered according to the first link to each item
  found on the trail page

* `reverse`: reverses the [[ikiwiki/pagespec/sorting]] order

* `circular`: if set to `yes` or `1`, the trail is made into a loop by
  making the last page's "next" link point to the first page, and the first
  page's "previous" link point to the last page

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
