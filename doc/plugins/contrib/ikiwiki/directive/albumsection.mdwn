The `albumsection` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/contrib/album desc=album]] plugin.

The `albumsection` directive is used to split an album into sections. It can
only appear on a page that also has the [[album]] directive.

The `filter` parameter is a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] against which viewer pages
are matched. The `albumsection` directive displays all the images that match
the filter, and the `album` directive displays any leftover images, like
this:

    # Holiday photos

    \[[!album]]
    <!-- replaced with a list of any uncategorized photos; it will be
         empty if they're all tagged as 'people' and/or 'landscapes' -->

    ## People

    \[[!albumsection filter="tagged(people)"]]
    <!-- replaced with a list of photos tagged 'people', including
         any that are also tagged 'landscapes' -->

    ## Landscapes

    \[[!albumsection filter="tagged(landscapes)"]]
    <!-- replaced with a list of photos tagged 'landscapes', including
         any that are also tagged 'people' -->
