The `trailitems` directive is supplied by the
[[!iki plugins/contrib/trail desc=trail]] plugin. It adds pages
to the trail represented by the current page, without producing any output
on that page.

    \[[!trailitems pages="posts/*" sort="age"]]

    \[[!trailitems pagenames="a b c"]]

Options are similar to [[!iki ikiwiki/directive/inline desc=inline]]:

* `pages`: adds pages that match a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] to the trail
  (cannot be used with `pagenames`)

* `pagenames`: adds a space-separated list of pages to the trail,
  with the same [[ikiwiki/SubPage/LinkingRules]] as for a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]]
  (cannot be used with `pages`)

* `sort`: add the pages matched by `pages` to the trail in this
  [[ikiwiki/pagespec/sorting]] order (cannot be used with `pagenames`)

* `reverse`: reverse the order of `sort` (cannot be used with `pagenames`)

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
