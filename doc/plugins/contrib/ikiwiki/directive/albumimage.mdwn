The `albumimage` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/contrib/album desc=album]] plugin.

Each viewer page produced by the [[album]] directive
contains an `albumimage` directive, which is replaced by an
[[ikiwiki/directive/img]], wrapped in some formatting using a
template (by default it's `albumviewer.tmpl`). That template can also include
links to the next and previous photos, in addition to those provided by the
[[!iki plugins/contrib/trail desc=trail]] plugin.

The next/previous links are themselves implemented by evaluating a template,
either `albumnext.tmpl` or `albumprev.tmpl` by default.

The directive can also have parameters:

* `title`, `date`, `updated`, `author`, `authorurl`, `copyright`, `license`
  and `description` are short-cuts for the corresponding
  [[ikiwiki/directive/meta]] directives

* `caption` sets a caption which is displayed near this image in the album
  and viewer pages

The viewer page can also contain any text and markup before or after the
`albumimage` directive, which will appear before or after the image in the
viewer page.
