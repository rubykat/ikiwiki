[Remark.js](http://remarkjs.com) makes web slides from Markdown. This
plugin integrates Remark into ikiwiki. Simply write `your_slides.remark`
instead of `your_blog_post.mdwn`, separating slides with `---`.

To set shared styles across all presentations on your site, put them in
a top-level `remarklocal.css`. To set per-presentation styles, use the
[[localstyle]] plugin as usual.

## Problem: `inline`

Web slides are sort of a regular web page, but not exactly: no action
links, and almost none of the other accoutrements of `page.tmpl`. The
branch's current behavior is that Remark slides are naively inlined like
any other page, which -- because the Markdown is deliberately not being
rendered by ikiwiki -- results in the slide source being displayed (and
not elegantly). Clicking through to the slides works right, of course.

See [[Discussion#inline]].

## Problem: safety of web-editing

This plugin is not currently safe for wikis where `.remark` pages can be
edited by untrusted users; the [[plugins/htmlscrubber]] is unlikely to be
able to prevent cross-site scripting in this plugin. Make sure only trusted
(administrative) users can create or edit `.remark` pages.
