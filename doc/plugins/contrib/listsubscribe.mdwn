This plugin provides the `listsubscribe` directive, which inserts a web
form for your readers to subscribe to a mailing list. The directive
takes a required `listname` parameter, which must refer to one of the
lists named in the wiki setup file.

## Example

In `ikiwiki.setup`:

    add_plugins:
    - listsubscribe
    
    listsubscribe:
      'my supercool mailing list': supercool-subscribe@neato.great

(Where `supercool-subscribe@neato.great` is the subscription address
provided by your mailing list manager.)

In any wiki page:

    [[!listsubscribe listname="my supercool mailing list"]]
