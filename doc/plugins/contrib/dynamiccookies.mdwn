This plugin populates ikiwiki's cookiejar by calling an external
program. The program is expected to print the serialized cookies
on `stdout` in a form which can be `eval`'d (e.g., `Data::Dumper`).

The plugin author's use case for this seemingly hacky interface:
aggregating authenticated feeds at work, where for various reasons
the needed cookies must be acquired using a separate `perl` from
the one used by ikiwiki.
