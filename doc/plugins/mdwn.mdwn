This plugin lets ikwiki convert files with names ending in ".mdwn" to html.
It uses the [[ikiwiki/markdown]] minimal markup language.

This is the standard markup language used by ikiwiki, although some others
are also available in other plugins.

There are several implementations of markdown support that can be used by
this plugin. In order of preference:

* [Discount](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/),
  via the [[!cpan Text::Markdown::Discount]] perl module.
* The [[!cpan Text::Markdown]] perl module.
* The [original version of markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

[[!cpan Text::MultiMarkdown]] can be used in order to use tables, footnotes,
and other new features from the markdown variant called
[multimarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/MultiMarkdown/). Multimarkdown is
not enabled by default, but can be turned on via the `multimarkdown` option
in the setup file. Note that multimarkdown's metadata and wikilinks
features are disabled when it's used with ikiwiki.
