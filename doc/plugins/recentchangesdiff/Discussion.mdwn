couldn't the diff be displayed as a popup? right now it's too bad because the diff is actually in the page, generated and downloaded, but the user can't see it. I have tried to address the issue by adding stuff to the change.tmpl template, but I may be missing something - and it doesn't quite look right:

     <div class="diff">
     <pre>
     <TMPL_VAR DIFF>

There are a few things wrong with this:

 1. I don't like the hardcoded javascript in there, we should use [[plugins/toggle]] or something, but i am not sure how to make the this plugin depend on toggle, or if it is desirable. 
 2. it doesn't work at all: first it doesn't actually "toggle" and second the javascript somehow gets filtered out of the resulting HTML so we don't even see it
 3. if the diffurl parameter is set in the template, we'd actually see two sets of glasses, which is silly. i tried moving the diff button upwards into the PAGES loop, but there the diffurls are file-specific, which also seem quite silly

I am looking for guidance on how to improve and fix this now. --[[anarcat]] 2011-10-11
